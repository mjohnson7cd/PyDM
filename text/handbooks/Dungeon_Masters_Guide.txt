INTRODUCTION 

r 

T'S GOOD TO BE  THE DU NGEON MASTER!  NOT ONLY 
d? y~u get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, 
v1llams, monsters, and magic, but you also get 
to create the world in which these stories live. 
Whether you're running a D&D game already 
or you think it's something you want to  try, this 
book is for you. 

The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you know 
the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying 
game. If you haven't played before, the DuNGEONS f!f> 
DRAGONS Starter Set is a great starting point for new 
players and DMs. 

This book has two important companions: the Player's 

Handbook, which contains the rules your players need 
to  create characters and the rules you need to run the 
game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to(cid:173)
use monsters to populate your D&D world. 

THE DUNGEON MASTER 
The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force 
behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the 
other players to explore, and also creates and runs 
adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically 
hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and 
can be as short as a single game session. Longer 
adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that 
require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung 
together, these adventures form an ongoing campaign. 
A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and 
last for months or years. 

A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the 
architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures 
by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other 
players' characters (the adventurers) to discover. As 
a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize 
what's happening around them, improvising when the 
adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. 
As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and 
supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a 
referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to 
abide by them and when to change them. 

Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, 
refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, 
and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It 
helps to remember that DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS is a 
hobby,  and being the DM should be fun.  Focus .on the 
aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if 
you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use 
published ones. You  can also lean on the other players 
to help you with rules mastery and world-building. 

The D&D rules help you and the other players have 
a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the 
DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your 
goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a 
campaign world that revolves around their actions and 
decisions, and to keep your players coming back for 
more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will 
echo in the memories of your players long after the final 
game session is concluded. 

How TO UsE THIS BooK 
This  book is orga nized in three parts. The first part 
helps you  decide what kind of campaign you'd like to 
run. The s econd part helps you create the adventures(cid:173)
the stories-that will compose the campaign and 
keep the players entertained from one game session 
to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the 
rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of 
your campa ign. 
PART 1:  MASTER OF WORLDS 
Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign 
world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from 
a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for 
the D&D game, you make that world your own over the 
course of a campaign. 

The world where you set your campaign is one of 

countless worlds that make up the D&D multiverse, 
a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures 
happen. Even if you're using an established world such 
as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place 
in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where 
Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital 
games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to 
change as you see fit  and yours to modify as you explore 
the consequences of the players' actions. 

Your world is more than just a backdrop for 

adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless 
other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you 
can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well(cid:173)
designed and well-run world seems to flow around the 
adventurers, so that they feel  part of something, instead 
of apart from it. 

Consistency is a key to a believable fictional 

world. When the adventurers go  back into town for 
supplies, they should encounter the same nonplayer 
characters.(NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll  learn 
the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember 
theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of 
consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If 
the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the 
stables, they might discover that the man who ran the 
place went back home to the large city over the hills, 
and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of · 
change- one that has nothing to do with the adventurers 
directly, but one that they'll notice- makes the players 
feel  as though their characters are part of a living world 
that changes and grows along with them. 

Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. 
Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and 
helps you nail down a few important details about your 
world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you 
put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, 
expanding on the information presented in the Player's 
Handbook to discuss the planes of existence and the 
gods and how you can put them together to serve the 
needs of your campaign.

PART 2:  MASTER OF ADVENTURES 
Whether you write your own adventures or use 
published ones, expect to invest preparation time 
beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll 
need to carve out some free time to exercise your 
creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new 
NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to 
foreshadow story events yet to come. 

Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create 
and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic 
elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you 
create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines 
and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, 
the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers 
the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about 
treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help 
keep the players invested in your campaign. 

PART  3:  MASTER OF  RULES 
DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS  isn't a head-to-head competition, 
but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the 
game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the 
rules. As the player who creates the game world and the 
adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural 
fit  to take on the referee role. 
· 

As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the 
rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or 
she wants to do,  and the DM determines whether it is 
successful or not, in some cases asking the player to 
make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a 
player wants his or her character to take a swing at an 
ore, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the 
ore's Armor Class. 

The rules don't account for every possible situation 

that might arise during a typical D&D session. For 

example, a player might want his or her character to 
hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. 
How you determine the outcome of this action is up to 
you. You  might tell the player to make a Strength check, 
while mentally setting the Difficulty Class (DC) at 15. 
If the Strength check is successful, you then determine 
how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You 
might decide that it deals ld4 fire damage and imposes 
disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end 
of its next turn. You  roll the damage die (or let the player 
do it),  and the game continues. 

Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. 

If a player tells you, "I want to run up and attack the 
ore," but the character doesn't have enough movement 
to reach the ore, you say, "It's  too far away to move up 
and still attack. What would you like to do instead?" 
The player takes the information and comes up with a 
different plan. 

To referee the rules, you need to know them. You  don't 

have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook, 
but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, 
when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to 
find the proper reference. 

The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you 

need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth 
of information to  help you adjudicate the rules in a wide 
variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using 
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also 
includes options appropriate for certain play styles and 
campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, 
a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for 
madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such 
as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, 
chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains 
optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such 
as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting. 

INTRODUCTION

FIGHTING 
P layers who enjoy fantasy combat like kicking the 
ta r out of villains and monsters. They look for any 
excuse to start a fight,  favoring bold action over careful 
deliberation. 

Engage players who like fighting by ... 
•  springing unexpected combat encounters on them. 
vividly describing the havoc their characters wreak 
with their attacks and spells. 
including combat encounters with large numbers of 
weak monsters. 

•  interrupting social interaction and exploration 

with combat. 

OPTIMIZING 
Players who enjoy optimizing their characters' 
capabilities like to fine-tune their characters for peak 
combat performance by gaining levels, new features, 
and magic items. They welcome any opportunity to 
demonstrate their characters' superiority. 

Engage players who like optimization by ... 

ensuring steady access to new abilities and spells. 

•  using desired magic items as adventure hooks. 

including encounters that let their characters shine. 
providing quantifiable rewards, like experience points, 
for noncombat encounters. 

PROBLEM  SOLVING 
Players who want to solve problems like to scrutinize 
NPC motivations, untangle a villain's machinations, 
solve puzzles, and come up with plans. 

Engage players who like to solve problems by ... 
•  including encounters that emphasize problem-solving. 
rewarding planning and tactics with in-game benefits. 

•  occasionally allowing a smart plan to grant an easy 

win for the players. 
creating NPCs with complex motives. 

STORYTELLING 
Players who love storytelling want to contribute to a 
narrative. They like it when their characters are heavily 
invested in an unfolding story, and they enjoy encounters 
that are tied to and expand an overarching plot. 

Engage players who like storytelling by ... 

using their characters' backgrounds to help shape the 
stories of the campaign. 

•  making sure an encounter advances the story 

in some way. 

•  making their characters' actions help steer 

future events. 
giving NPCs ideals, bonds, and flaws that the adven(cid:173)
turers can exploit. 

KNow YouR PLAYERS 
The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to 
entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas 
their role is to create characters (the protagonists of 
the campaign), breathe life into them , and help steer 
the campaign through their characters' actions, your 
role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and 
immersed in the world you've created, and to  let their 
characters do awesome things. 

Knowing what your players enjoy most about the 

D&D game helps you create and run adventures that 
they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of 
the following activities each player in your group enjoys 
the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your 
players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping 
them engaged. 

ACTING 
Players who enjoy acting like getting into character 
and speaking in their characters' voices. Roleplayers 
at heart, they enjoy social interactions with NPCs, 
monsters, and their fellow party members. 

Engage players who like acting by ... 

giving them opportunities to develop their characters' 
personalities and backgrounds. 

•  allowing them to interact regularly with NPCs. 

adding roleplaying elements to combat encounters. 
incorporating elements from their characters' back(cid:173)
grounds into your adventures. 

ExPLORING 
Players who desire exploration want to experience the 
wonders that a fantasy world has to offer. They want to 
know what's around the next corner or hill. They also 
like to find  hidden clues and treasure. 

Engage players who like exploration by ... 

dropping clues that hint at things yet to come. 
letting them find  things when they take the time 
to explore. 
providing rich descriptions of exciting environments, 
and using interesting maps and props. 

•  giving monsters secrets to uncover or cultural 

details to learn. 

INSTIGATING 
Player's who like to instigate action are eager to make 
things happen, even if that means taking perilqus risks. 
They would rather rush headlong into danger and face 
the consequences than face boredom. 

Engage players who like to instigate by ... 

allowing them to affect their surroundings. 

•  including things in your adventures to tempt them. 

letting their actions put the characters in a tight spot. 
including encounters with NPCs who are as feisty and 
unpredictable as they are.

OUR WORLD IS TH E SETTING  FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN , 
the place where adventures happen. Even 
if you use an existing setting, such as the 
Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you 
set your adventures there, create characters 
to  inhabit it, and make changes to it over 

the course of your campaign. This chapter is all about 
building your world and then creating a campaign to 
take place in it. 

THE BIG PICTURE 
This book, the Player's Handbook, and the Monster 
Manual present the default assumptions for how the 
worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of 
D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, 
and Mystara don't stray very far from  those 
assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, 
Raven loft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further 
away from that baseline. As you create your own world, 
it's up to you to  decide where on the spectrum you want 
your world to  fall. 

CoRE AssuMPTIONS ______ _ 
The rules of the game are based on the following core 
assumptions about the game world. 

Gods Oversee the World. The gods are real and 
embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming 
dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, 
forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world 
by granting divine magic to their followers and sending 
signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god 
serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent 
seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its 
rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, 
none can deny their existence. 

Much of the World Is Untamed. Wild regions 

abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms 
of various sizes dot the Ia ndscape, but beyond their 
borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they 
live in well. They've heard stories of other places from 
merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond 
the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless 
they've  been there themselves. 

The World Is Ancient. Empires rise and fall , leaving 

few places that have not been touched by imperial 
grandeur or decay. War,  time, and natural forces 
eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with 
places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations 
and their knowledge survive in legends, magic 
items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an 
empire's collapse. 

Conflict Shapes the World's History. Powerful 

individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and 
factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course 
of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic 
prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and 
shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. 
The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as 

they compete with each other for power. Some seek to 
preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others 
strive toward evil ends, seeking to  rule the world with 
an iron fist.  Still others seek goals that range from 
the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation 
of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. 
Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, 
creating conflict that can steer the world's fate. 

The World Is Magical.  Practitioners of magic are 
relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of 
their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous 
and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to 
something much more rare and impressive, such as a 
levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates 
of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches 
of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as 
magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters 
created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with 
magical abilities.

In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with 
the core assumptions and consider how your setting 
might change them. The subsequent sections of this 
chapter address each element and give details on how to 
flesh out your world with gods, factions,  and so forth. 
The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved 

in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of 
adventure, but they're not the on ly set of assumptions 
that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign 
concept by altering one or more of those core 
assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have 
done. Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions 
weren't true in my world?" 

The World Is a Mundane Place. What if magic is rare 
and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no 
access to  it? What if your campaign is set in a version of 
our own world's history? 

The World Is New. What if your world is new, and 
the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? 
The adventurers might be champions of the first 
great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and 
Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting. 

The World Is Known. What if the world is completely 

charted and mapped, right down to the "Here there be 
dragons" notations? What if great empires cover huge 
stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders 
between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting 
were once part of a great empire, and magically aided 
travel between its cities is commonplace. 

Monsters Are Uncommo"n.  What if monsters are 
rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific 
domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The 
populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords 
and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble 
people's daily lives. 

Magic Is Everywhere. What if every town is ruled 
by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are 
common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic

trains carry travelers from one great city to another. 
Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent. 

What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the 
characters can challenge them and seize their power? 
Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never 
make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the 
gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and 
clerics rely instead on elemental power for  their magic. 
Gons OF YouR WoRLD 
Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a 
number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not 
united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your 
game, including the gods of established D&D worlds 
and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of 
these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose 
deities and ideas from them as you please. See "A 
Sample Pantheon" in this section for an example. 

As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't 

matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church 
devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose 
domains, not deities, so your world can associate 
domains with deities in any way you choose. 

LOOSE  PANTHEONS 
Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. 
A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of 
existence, variously cooperating with and competing 
against one another to administer the affairs of the 
universe. People gather in public shrines to worship 
gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to 
venerate gods of deception or destruction. 

Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is 

responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the 
Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who 

calls clerics and paladins to  his service and encourages 
them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, 
chival ry,  and justice in society. Even in the midst of his 
everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and 
tyra nny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war 
fought nobly and in the cause of justice. 

People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring 

deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of 
other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, 
regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a 
person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out 
to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at 
harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting. 
Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's 

service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly 
devoted individuals become priests by setting up a 
shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, 
those who feel  such a calling become clerics or paladins 
invested with the responsibility of true divine power. 

Shrines and temples serve as community gathering 
points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such 
sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their 
patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform 
religious rites, and provide training in activities their 
deities favor.  Cities and large towns can host several 
temples dedicated to individual gods important to the 
community, while smaller settlements might have a 
single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere. 
To quickly build a pantheon for your world, crea~e 
a single god for each of the eight domains available 
to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, 
Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names 
and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities 
from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small 
pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of 
existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other 
areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge,

A  SAMPLE  PANTHEO N 
The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a 
pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements 
to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is 
the default pantheon in the fourth edition Player's 
Handbook (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the 
Dawn War Deities table. 

This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities 
and establishes them as universal gods. These gods 
include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, 
Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and 
Corell on as gods of their respective portfolios, rather 
than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the 
archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny. 
Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, 
sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes 
from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come 
Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek 
pantheon come Athena (renamed Era this) and Tyche 
(renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set 
(renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. 
The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's He! 
and Greyhawk's Weejas. That leaves three gods created 
from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog: 

OTHER RELIGIOUS  SYSTEMS 
In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods 
who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic 
religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems 
(centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery 
cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, 
usually as part of a pantheon system), anjmistic 
religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or 
even forces and philosophies that don't center on deities. 

TIGHT PANTHEONS 
In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses 
on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace 
a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon 
might favor one of its member deities over another, 
but they respect all the deities and honor them with 
sacrifices and prayer as appropriate. 

The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers 

embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the 
deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to 
protect and guide their followers. You can think of a 
tight pantheon as similar to a family.  One or two deities 
who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with 
the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the 
culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple 
honors all members of the pantheon. 

Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant 

gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the 
priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually 
evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the 
Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, 
attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. 
These cults resemble mystery cults, their members 

strictly devoted to their single god, though even 
members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples 
of the tight pantheon. 

The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight 
pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father 
figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr,  and Freya embody 
important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki 
and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding 
the other deities, and sometimes working against them 
with the pantheon's enemies. 

MYSTERY CULTS 
A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization 
based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is 
mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related 
gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned 
with the initiate's relationship with the divine. 

Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within 

a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of 
the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as 
primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might 
immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god 
who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon. 

A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god , 

which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. 
The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple 
and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey 
to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often 
revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities(cid:173)
gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature. 

DIVINE  RANK 
The divine  beings of the multiverse are often categorized 
according to their cosmic power.  Some gods are worshiped 
on  multiple worlds and  have a different  rank on  each world, 
depending on their influence there. 

Greater deities are  beyond  mortal  understanding. They 
can't be summoned, and they are almost always  removed 
from  direct involvement in  mortal affairs.  On  very  rare 
occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities,  but 
slaying a greater god's avatar has  no effect on the god  itself. 

Lesser deities are embodied somewhere in  the planes. 
Some lesser deities live  in  the  Material  Plane,  as  does the 
unicorn-goddess  Lurue of the  Forgotten  Realms  and the 
titanic shark-god  Sekolah  revered  by the sahuagin. Others 
live  on the Outer Planes,  as  Lolth  does  in  the Abyss.  Such 
deities can  be encountered by  mortals. 

Quasi-deities have a divine origin,  but they don't hear or 
answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of 
mortal  life. They are still  immensely powerful  beings, and  in 
theory they could ascend to godhood  if they amassed enough 
worshipers. Quasi-deities fall  into three subcategories: 
demigods, titans, and  vestiges . 

Demigods are born from  the union of a deity and a mortal 

being. They  have some divine attributes,  but their mortal 
parentage  makes them the weakest quasi-deities. 

Titans are the divine creations of deities. They  might be 

birthed from  the union  of two deities,  manufactured on 
a divine forge,  born from  the blood  spilled  by  a god,  or 
otherwise brought about through divine will  or substance. 

Vestiges  are deities who  have  lost nearly all  their worshipers 
and are considered dead, from  a mortal  perspective.  Esoteric 
rituals can  sometimes contact these beings and draw on 
their latent power. 

"""' 

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

TI 

The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its 
foundation  myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps 
in order to share the god's ultimate fate.  In the case of 
dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate 
represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth 
into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into 
a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs 
but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is 
promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also 
experiences new meaning in life. 

MONOTHEISM 
Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in 
some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you 
introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, 
you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if 
they don't, other religions can exist side by side with 
the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics 
with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered 
by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities 
(possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, 
fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith. 

The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive 

portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in 
control of everything, and concerned with every aspect 
of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers 
and sacrifices to  the same god regardless of what 
aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether 
marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping 
to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to 
the same god. 

Some monotheistic religions describe different 

aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different 
aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics 
of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining 
their domain access and possibly even their alignment 
on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer 
aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while 
one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life 
or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, 
clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to 
differentiate clerics who choose different domains. 

DUALISM 
A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for 
a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities 
or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are 
good and evil, or opposed deities representing those 
forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law 
and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic 
system. Life and death, light and darkness, rna  ter and 
spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and 
defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the 
D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve 
as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the 
terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair 
is usually believed to be good- beneficial, desirable, 
or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not 
explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is 
expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, 
the followers of that religion believe that one of the two 
(usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and 

so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world 
and its evils through asceticism and contemplation. 

Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing 

forces must remain in balance, always pulling away 
from each other but remaining bound together in 
creative tension. 

In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between 

good and evil, mortals are expected to ta ke sides. The 
majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship 
the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of 
the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to 
protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because 
the evil  deity in such a religion is usually the source 
of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the 
perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters 
and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The 
myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the 
good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the 
forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't 
predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory. 
Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. 

All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, 
and therefore all things can fall  on one side or the other 
of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, 
and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and 
famine , hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity. 

ANIMISM 
Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of 
the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything 
has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest 
rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the 
sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these 
objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, 
though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent 
than others. The most powerful spirits might even 
be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not 
veneration. 

Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit 

over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices 
to different spirits at different times, as appropriate 
to the situation. A pious character might make daily 
prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits 
of the house, regular petitions to  important spirits 
such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional 
sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the 
spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other 
spirits as well. 

An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don't 
care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long 
as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. 
As new religions spread through animist lands, those 
religions typically win adherents but not converts. 
People incorporate new spirits and deities into their 
prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives 
and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and 
practices without changing their belief in and respect 
for the spirits they already venerate. 

Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist 

clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can 
choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for 
that cleric. 

12 

CHAPTER  I  j  A  WORLD  Of YOUR OWN 

FORCES AND  PHILOSOPHIES 
Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. 
In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction 
in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical  ·,  · 
power from that conviction. In other campaigns, 
impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods 
by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as 
druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the 
force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, 
some clerics devote themselves to  ideals rather than to 
a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and 
chivalry rather than a specific deity. 

' 

Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't 

beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept 
sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't 
necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can 
be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship 
to various good deities, or revere the force of nature 
and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might 
be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal 
force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable 
power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a 
philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a 
common philosophical belief states that the deities are 
more like mortals than they would have mortals  believe. 
According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly 
immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain 
divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate 
goal of some philosophies. 

. 

The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that 
mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person 
believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power 
on that person. 

HUMANOIDS  AND  THE  GODS 
When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider 
range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In 
many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and 
other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected 
that an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of 
subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces 
a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture 
might have its own array of gods. 

In most D&D settings, there is no single god that 

can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human 
proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. 
A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire 
kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that 
prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the 
prophet's followers might turn against one another and 
found several competing religions. 

In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in 
stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify 
Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves 
might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are 
pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His 
teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in 
dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to 
replace him. 

With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in 

your world and their ties to  different humanoid races. 
· Does each race have a creator god? How does that god 

• 

shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such 
divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race 
turned against the god that created it? Has a new race 
appeared, created by a god within the past few years? 

A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble 
line, or other cultural institution. With the death of 
the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine 
portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in 
its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other 
gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled. 

Finally, consider the difference between gods who 

are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with 
more diverse followers. Do the races with their own 
pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with 
their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the 
other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the 
deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor 
of one god or another? 

CHAPTER 1  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

KINGDOM  SCALE 
On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. 
A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size 
of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. 
That's plenty of room for adventuring. 

The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to 

sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water 
in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A 
coastal region might include islands offshore, and a 
landlocked area might include an inland sea or major 
lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single 
large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple 
coastlines. 

Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills 
form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, 
and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. 

That leaves the rest of your map for relatively fiat 

terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place 
these elements as you see fit. 

Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through 

the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas 
that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest 
major body of water that doesn't require the river to 
cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as 
they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea. 

Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. 
At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns 
and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. 
Even so, a settled region this size might easily have 
eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map. 

CONTINENT SCALE 
For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 
1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't 
see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest 
mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political 
boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how 
multiple kingdom-scale maps fi t together, rather than 
tracking the movement of adventurers day by day. 

The same process you use for mapping a region at 
kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. 
A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that 
deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade 
centers and the capitals of kingdoms. 

--~--------------

COMBINING SCALES 
Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or 
out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents 
the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities 
that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent 
map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, 
and might define the opposite ends of the region you're 
detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province(cid:173)
scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your 
province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale 
map and create interesting areas around it. 

MAPPING YouR CAMPAIGN 
When creating the world where your campaign takes 
place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two 
approaches with it:  top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs 
like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the 
world at the start of the campaign by having a map 
that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on 
smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite 
direction , starting with a small campaign area that is 
mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming 
out as adventures take the characters into new territory. 

Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for 
mapping outdoor environments where travel can go 
in any direction and calculating distance might be 
important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to 
the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map 
that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 
7 offers more information about creating and mapping 
wilderness areas. 

PROVINCE  SCALE 
For the most detailed areas of your world, use a 
province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A 
full-page map at this scale represents an area that 
can be covered in one day's travel in any direction 
from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As 
such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a 
campaign's starting area (see "Creating a Campaign," 
later in this chapter) or any location where you expect 
to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather 
than days. 

• 

The ground cover of an area this size will include 

broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken 
up by other isolated terrain types. 

A settled region mapped at this scale might have one 

town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. 
A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no 
settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of 
the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. 
On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few 
hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even 
small villages farm most of the arable land within a 
mile or two. 

I4 

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

SETTLEMENTS 
The places where people live-bustling cities, 
prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among 
miles of farmland- help define the nature of civilization 
in your world. A single settlement- a home base for 
your adventurers- is a great place to start a campaign 
and begin your world building. Consider the following 
questions as you create any settlement in your world: 

What purpose does it serve in your game? 
How big is it? Who lives there? 
What does it look, smell, a-nd sound like? 
Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part 
of a larger state? 
What are its defenses? 

•  Where do characters go to find  the goods and services 

they need? 

•  What temples and other organizations feature 

prominently? 

•  What fantastic elements distinguish it from an 

ordinary town? 
Why should the characters care about the settlement? 

The guidelines in this section are here to help you build 
the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have 
in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to 
your vision for a settlement. 

PURPOSE 
A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story 
and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the 
settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail 
you put into it.  Create only the features of a settlement 
that you know you'll need, along with notes on general 
features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the 
adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping 
notes on new places you invent. 

LOCAL COLOR 
A settlement might serve as a place where the 
characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement 
of this sort needs no more than a brief description. 
Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, 
add a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries 
never lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get 
on with their business. The history of the inn where 
the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the 
shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this 
level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters 
return to the same settlement, start adding these local 
features so that it begins to feel  a little more like a home 
base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop 
as the need arises. 

HOME  BASE 
A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, 
train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire 
campaign can center on a particular town or city. 
Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the 
characters go  out into the wider world. 

Designed well, a home base can hold a special place 

in the adventurers' hearts, particularly if they care about 
one or more NPCs who live there. 

To make a home base come alive, you'll need to 

invest some time fl eshing out details, but the players 
can help you with that work. Ask them to  tell you a bit 
about mentors, family members, and other important 
people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and 
modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid 
foundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are 
important to  the characters. Let the players describe 
where and how their characters spend their time- a 
favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps. 

Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, 

flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail 
its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed 
later in the chapter). Include characters who can 
provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, 
librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can 
provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note 
of merchants who might regularly interact with the 
adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for 
the party's business. Think about the people who run 
the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful 
of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired 
mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a 
dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign. 

ADVENTURE  SITE 
A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A 
town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered 
by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely 
rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In 
a settlement that doubles as an adventure location, 
detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers 
and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note 
the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This 
work is adventure preparation as much as it is world 
building, and the cast of characters you develop for 
your adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and 
extras- can become recurring figures in your campaign. 

SIZE 
Most settlements in a D&D world are villages clustered 
around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the 
town or city population with food in exchange for goods 
the farmers can't produce themselves. Towns and cities 
are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding 
area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the 
villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady 
lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city. 

VILLAGE 
Population: Up to about 1,000 
Government: A noble (usually not a resident) rules the 
village, with an appointed agent (a  reeve) in residence 
to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes. 

Defense: The reeve might have a small force of soldiers. 

Otherwise, the village relies on a citizen militia. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, 

possibly from an· inn or a trading post. Other goods 
are available from traveling merchants. 

Organizations: A village might contain one or two 

temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations. 

_ lost settlements are agricultural villages, supporting 
themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and 
meat. Villagers produce food  in one way or another-if 
not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do 
by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and 
the like. The goods they produce feed their families and 
upply trade with nearby settlements. 
A village's population is dispersed around a large area 
of land.  Farmers live on their land, which spreads them 
videly around the village center. At  the heart of the 
\·illage, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, 
a marketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place, 
and perhaps an inn for travelers. 

TowN 
Population: Up to about 6,000 
Government: A resident noble rules and appoints a lord 

mayor to oversee administration. An elected town 
council represents the interests of the middle class. 

Defense: The noble commands a sizable army of 

professional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, though 
exotic goods and services are harde·r to find.  Inns and 
taverns support travelers. 

Organizations: The town contains several temples, 

as well as various merchant guilds and other 
organizations. 

Towns are major trade centers, situated where important 
industries and reliable trade routes enabled the 
population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: 
!.he import of raw materials and food from surrounding 
·illages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, 
as well as to  other towns and cities. A town's population 
i  more diverse than that of most villages. 

Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the 

meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic 
defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar 
natural resources. 

C ITY 
Population: Up to about 25,000 
Government: A resident noble presides, with several 
other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding 
areas and government functions. One such noble is 
the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. 
An elected city council represents the middle class 
and might hold more actual power than the lord 
mayor. Other groups serve as important power 
centers as well. 

Defense: The city supports an army of professional 

soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in 
residence maintains a small force of personal 
bodyguards. 

Commerce: Almost any goods or services are readily 
available. Many inns and taverns support travelers. 

Organizations: A multitude of temples, guilds, and 

other organizations, some of which hold significant 
power in city affairs, can be found within the 
city's walls. 

Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger 
populations require considerable support from both 
urrounding villages and trade routes, so they're rare. 

Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses 
of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to 
trade, almost always on a navigable waterway. 

Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a 
city's growth are easily identified by the expansion of 
the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls 
naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods 
defined by specific features), which have their own 
representatives on the city council and their own noble 
administrators. 

Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people 

are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in 
the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free 
City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in 
the D&D worlds. 

-------

ATMOSPHERE 
What do the adventurers first notice as they approach 
or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling 
with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, 
pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of 
merchants and buyers thronging the market square? 
The overpowering stench of manure? 

Sensory details help bring a settlement to  life and 
vividly communicate its personality to your players. 
Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a 
settlement's personality and extrapolate from there. 
Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world 
Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory 
details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy 
waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing 
gondoliers, the smells of fish  and waste polluting 
the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is 
shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the 
tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and 
cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, 
the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of 
mystery and lurking danger. 

The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, 

its origin and inhabitants, its government and political 
position, and its commercial importance all have a 
bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against 
the edge of a jungle has a very different feel  than one 
on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present 
a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to 
human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell 
any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city 
fostering an early system of democracy might boast an 
open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as 
freely as produce. All  the possible combinations of these 
factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of 
your campaign world. 

GOVERNMENT 
In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, 
power and authority are concentrated in towns and 
cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements 
where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect 
taxes from  the populace, which they use for public 
building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a 
comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles 

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, 
they promise to protect their citizens from threats 
such as ore marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving 
human bandits. 

Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to 

supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges 
in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, 
or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they 
govern, chosen for their positions because they already 
hold the respect of their fellow citizens. 

Within towns and cities, lords share authority and 

administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually 
their own relatives), and also with representatives of 
the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord 
mayor of noble birth is appointed to  head the town or 
city council and to perform the same administrative 
functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council 
consists of representatives elected by the middle class. 
Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, 
since the economic power of the middle class is often 
more important to the prosperity of a town or city than 
the hereditary authority of the nobility. 

The larger a settlement, the more likely that other 
individuals or organizations hold significant power 
there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual-a 
wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more 
influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve 
avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns 
and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a 
prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or 
an individual with magical power. 

FORMS  OF  GOVERNMENT 
A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city 
might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city 
governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of 
a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote 
realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your 
settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or 
region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements 
might also lie under its control.

Typical and fantastical forms of government are 
described below. Choose one or randomly determine a 
form of government for a nation or city from the Forms 
of Government table. 

Autocracy. One hereditary ruler wields absolute 

power. The autocrat either is supported by a well(cid:173)
developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the 
only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The 
dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair 
and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign 
setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. 
Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizar.ds 
and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of 
Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead 
soldiers under his command. 

Bureaucracy. Various departments compose the 

government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The 
department heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to  a 
figurehead autocrat or council. 

Confederacy. Each individual city or town within 
the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a 
league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) 
the common good of all member states. Conditions and 
attitudes toward the central government vary from place 
to place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in 
the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of 
cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign 
setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans. 

Democracy. Citizens or their elected representatives 

determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or 
military carries out the day-to-day work of government, 
with positions filled through open elections. 

Dictatorship. One supreme ruler holds absolute 

authority, but his or her rule isn't necessarily dynastic. 
In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the 
Greyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is 
the dictator of a conquered land that bears his name. 

Feudalism. The typical government of Europe in 

the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers 
of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or 
scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, 
who in turn promise protection to their vassals. 

Gerontocracy. Elders preside over this society. In 

some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons 
are entrusted with the leadership of the land. 

Hierarchy. A feudal or bureaucratic government 
where every member, except one, is subordinate to 
another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, 
the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, 
with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon 
queen Takhisis. 

Kleptocracy. This government is composed of groups 
or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, 
often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping 
Bandit Kingdoms in the Grey hawk campaign setting 
are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds 
would also fall into this category. 

Magocracy. The governing body is composed of 
spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal 
lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. 
Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the 
Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer(cid:173)
kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting. 

Matriarchy or Patriarchy. This society is governed 

by the eldest or most important members of one gender. 
Draw cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for 

18 

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who 
answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. 

Meritocracy. The most intelligent and educated 

people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy 
to  handle the day-to-day work of government. In the 
Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the 
fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of 
lore called the Keeper. 

Militocracy. Military leaders run the nation under 

ma rtial law, using the army and other armed forces. A 
militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, 
an order of dragon riders , or a league of sea princes. 

olamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance 

ca mpaign setting, falls into this category. 

Monarchy. A single hereditary sovereign wears the 
crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch's powers are 
limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a 
democracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom 
of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both 
a parliament that makes laws and a monarch who 
enforces them. 

Oligarchy. A small number of absolute rulers share 

power, possibly dividing the land into districts or 
provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. 
_.\group of adventurers who take control of a nation 
together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of 
Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction 
leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead. 

Plutocracy. Society is governed by the wealthy. The 
elite form a ruling council, purchase representati"on at 
rhe court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default 
because money is the true power in the realm. Many 
cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, 
including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, are plutocracies. 
Republic. Government is entrusted to representatives 

of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the 
electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or 
certain classes can vote could be considered a republic. 
Satrapy. Conquerors and representatives of another 

government wield power, ruling the settlement or region 
as  part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats 
and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. 
The cities of High port and Suder ham in the Greyhawk 
ca mpaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a 
,·icious gang of marauders known as the Slave Lords. 
Theocracy. Rulership falls to a direct representative 
or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power 
in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In 
the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is 
a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit 
that resides in Thrane's capital of Flamekeep.

COMMERCE 
Even small villages can provide characters access to the 
gear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions, 
tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly 
available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial 
weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have 
inns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find 
a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to 
be desired. 

Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, 

including larger towns and cities. Merchants pass 
through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the 
vil,Iagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching 
contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass 
on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as 
they conduct their business. Since merchants make 
their living traversing roads that might be menaced 
by bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to 
keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town 
to town, including reports of situations that cry out for 
the attention of adventurers. 

These merchants can't provide the services normally 
found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in 
need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can 
handle the griffon eggs they've found , or an architect to 
design their castle, they're better off going to a large city 
than looking in a village. 

CURRENCY 
The straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver 
piece" (sp), "copper piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep), 
and "platinum piece" (pp) are used throughout the game 
rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations 
with more interesting descriptions in your game 
world. People give coins specific names, whether 
as plain as "dime" or lively as "gold double-eagle." A 
country typically mints its own currency, which might 
correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few 
currencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly 
all coins are accepted worldwide-except by those 
looking to pick a fight with a foreigner. 

ExAMPLE :  THE FoRGOTTEN REALMS 
The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an 
extensive example of currencies. Although barter, 
blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common 
enough in Faerfin, metal coins and trade bars are the 
everyday currency. 

Common Coinage. Coins appear in a bewildering 

variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks 
to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation's oddly 
shaped coins can be found throughout Faerfin. In 
S embia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. 
Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped 
electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue 
eyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia 
doesn't mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted 
in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces 
from abroad. 

In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center 

of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards, 

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

19 

electrum pieces are moons, gold  pieces are dragons, 
and platinum coins are suns. The city's two local coins 
are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square 
brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to  permit 
it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in 
the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor 
moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central 
hole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional 
use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at 
once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp 
elsewhere. 

The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent(cid:173)
shaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, 
worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also 
issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which 
looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver 
wedge to  form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city 
and 2 ep outside it. 

The favored form of currency in the kingdom of 

Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with 
a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the 
other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are 
silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces 
are golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns. 

Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold 
pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these 
lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other 
nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from 
certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of 
Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms 
when trading abroad because their own coins and 
tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are 
s hunned by others. 

Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands 

and centers of great magic are honored, though those 
who find  them are wise to sell them to collectors rather 
than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the 
old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: 
thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs 
(electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). 
These coins a re fine , numerous, and sometimes still 
used in trade among elves.

Trade Bars. Large numbers of coins can be difficult 

to  transport and account for.  Many merchants prefer 
to use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys 
(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. 
Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the 
trading company or government that originally crafted 
them. These bars are valued by weight, as follows: 

•  A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 

inches long, 2 inches wide, and  1/2 inch thick. 
A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 
inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. 
A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the 
size of a 2-pound silver bar. 

The city of Baldur's Gate mints large numbers of 

silver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of 
currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle(cid:173)
shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 
2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less 
in nearby trade centers, a nd as iron is normally valued 
elsewhere (1  sp per pound). 

Odd Currency.  Coins and bars aren't the only forms 

of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth 
10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar 
rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded 
onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp 
per slice. 

CREATING YouR OwN 
As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't 
need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each 
country and era can have its own coins with its own 
values. Your adventurers might travel through many 
different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding 
· six hundred ancient bed oars from the rule of Coronal 
Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense 
of immersion in your world than finding 60 sp. 

Varying names and descriptions of coins for the 

major contemporary and historical realms of your world 
adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of 
Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a 
nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic 
faces and called torments, that currency expresses a 
distinct flavor. 

Creating new coins connected to specific locations, 
like the toals ofWaterdeep or the eclipsed moons of 
Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as 
you keep the value of these new coins simple (in  other 
words, don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local 
flavor to key locations in your world without adding 
undue complexity. 

LANGUAGES AND  DIALECTS 
When fleshing out your world, you can create new 
languages and dialects to  reflect its unique geography 
and history. You can replace the default languages 
presented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or 
split languages up into several different dialects. 

In some worlds, regional differences might be much 

more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the 
dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom 
speak a common language, which is completely different 

11ARPER5 

ORDER  OF  THE  GAUNTLET 

EMERALD  ENCLAVE 

LoRDs'  ..ALLIANCE 

ZHENTARIM 

from that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This 
m ight make communication (and diplomacy) between 
rwo kingdoms significantly more difficult. 

Widely used languages might have ancient versions, 
or there might be completely different ancient tongues 
that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such 
languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions 
and tomes that characters encounter. 

You might invent additional secret languages, besides 
Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain 
organizations or political affiliations to communicate. 
You could even decide that each alignment has its 
own language, which might be more of an argot used 
primarily to discuss philosophical concepts. 

In a region where one race has subjugated another, 
the language of the conquerors can become a mark of 
ocial status. Similarly, reading and writing might be 
restricted by law to  the upper classes of a society. 

FACTIONS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS 
Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and 
colleges are important for.ces in the social order of 
any civilization. Their influence might stretch across 
multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly 
wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can 
play an important part in the Jives of player characters, 
becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like 
ind ividual non player characters. When characters join 
these organizations, they become part of something 
larger than themselves, which can give their adventures 
a context in the wider world. 

ADVENTURERS AND  ORGANIZATIONS 
At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great 
way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game 
progresses, though, background ties often become less 
important. 

Factions and organizations aimed at player characters 

are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected 
m your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear 
agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, 
Yillainous organizations create an ongoing sense of 
menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes. 

Having different characters tied to different factions 

can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as 
long as those factions have similar goals and don't work 
in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers 

representing different factions might have competing 
interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals. 

Adventurer organizations are also a great source of 

special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. 
Increased standing in an organization has value in and 
of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits 
such as access to an organization's information, 
equipment, magic, and other resources. 

CREATING FACTIONS 
Factions and organizations that you  create for your 
campaign should grow out of the stories that are 
important to the world. Create organizations that your 
players will want to interact with, whether as allies, 
members, or enemies. 

As a starting point, decide what role you want an 

organization to play in  the world. What is it all about? 
What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do 
its members do? Answering these questions should 

SAMPLE  FACTION: THE  HARPERS 
The  Harpers is  a scattered  network of spellcasters  and  spies 
who advocate equality and  covertly oppose the abuse of 
power,  magical or otherwise. 

The organization has  risen , been  shattered, and  risen 

again  several  times.  Its  longevity and  resilience are  largely 
due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the 
autonomy of its various  members. The  Harpers have  small 
cells  and  lone operatives throughout the  Forgotten  Realms, 
although they interact and  share information with  one 
another from time to time as  needs warrant. The  Harpers' 
ideology is  noble, and  its  members pride themselves on  their 
ingenuity and  incorruptibility.  Harpers don't seek  power or 
glory,  only fair and  equal treatment for all . 

Motto.  "Down with tyranny.  Fairness  and  equality for all." 
Beliefs. The  Harpers' beliefs can  be  summarized as  follows: 

One can  never have too much  information or arcane 
knowledge. 

•  Too  much  power leads to corruption, and the abuse of 

magic in  particular must be  closely monitored. 
No one  should  be  powerless . 

Goals.  Gather information throughout FaerCln,  discern 
the political dynamics within each  region,  and  promote 
fairness  and  equality by  covert means. Act openly as  a last 
resort. Thwart tyrants and  any leader,  government, or group 
that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor,  and the 
oppressed . 

Typical Quests. Typical  Harper quests include securing 

an  artifact that would upset the balance of power in  a 
region,  gathering information on  a powerful individual or 
organization , and  determining the true intentions of an 
ambitious political figur~ or evil  spellcaster. 

CHAPTER  l  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

give you a good sense of the organization's personality. 
From there, think about typical members. How might 
people describe them? What are the typical members' 
classes and alignments? What personality traits do they 
tend to share? 

Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization 

is a way of summing up the work you've done so far. 
A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a 
very different personality from one that uses a winged 
viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also 
a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as 
you've defined it.  Consider the motto of the Harpers: 
"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." The 
Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom 
and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a 
group of politically allied cities in the North calling 
themselves the Lords' Alliance: "Threats to home must 
be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our 
security." These are sophisticated people involved in 
a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on 
stability than on fairness and equality. 

Finally, think about the ways that player characters 

might come into contact with the organization. Who 
are the important members-not just the leaders, 
but the agents in the field  that the adventurers might 
encounter? Where are they active, and where do they 
have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do 
join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What 
rewards can they gain? 

RENOWN 
Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an 
adventurer's standing within a particular faction or 
organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts 
at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and 
reputation within a particular organization. You can tie 
benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and 
titles within the organization and access to  resources. 

A player tracks renown separately for each 

organization his or her character is a member of.  For 
example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within 
one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the 
character's interaction with each organization over the 
course of the campaign. 

GAINING RENOWN 
A character earns renown by completing missions or 
quests that serve an organization's interests or involve 
the organization directly. You award renown at your 
discretion as characters complete these missions 
or quests, typically at the same time you award 
experience points. 

EXAMPLES  OF  FACTION  RANKS 

Advancing an organization's interests increases 
a character's renown within that organization by 1. 
Completing a mission specifically assigned by that 
organization, or which directly benefits the organization, 
increases the character's renown by 2 instead. 

For example, characters with connections to the noble 

Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which 
they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. 
Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might 
increase each character's  renown within the order 
by 1.  Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission 
given to the adventurers by a senior member of the 
order, completing the task might instead increase each 
character's  renown by 2, showing the adventurers as 
effective allies. 

Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box 

of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to 
a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might 
increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 
since this action directly increased that group's power 
and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an 
agent of the Zhentarim. 

BENEFITS  OF  RENOWN 
The benefits of increasing renown within an 
organization can include rank and authority, friendly 
attitudes from members of the organization, and 
other perks. 

Rank. Characters can earn promotions as their 

renown increases. You  can establish certain thresholds 
of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not 
necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in 
rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. 
For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance 
after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining 
the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the 
organization increases, he or she might be eligible for 
further increases in rank. 

You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a 

character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have 
to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at 
least lOth level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level 
to be a lioncrown. 

You can set these thresholds of renown to any 

numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate 
ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign. 
Attitudes of Organization Members. As a character's 

renown within an organization grows, members of 
that organization are increasingly likely to have heard 
of the character. You can set thresholds at which the 
default attitude of an organization's members toward 
the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For 
example, members of the Emerald Enclave- a faction

dedicated to preserving the natural order-might be 
less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated 
at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming 
-riendly by default only when a character has gained 10 
renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds 
apply only to the default attitude of most members of an 
organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC 
faction members might dislike an adventurer despite 
that character's renown-or perhaps because of it. 

Perks. Earning a rank within an organization comes 
with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of 
low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and 
adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to 
offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked 
character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, "Creating 
_ -onplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls, 
the ability to call in a favor,  or backup on dangerous 
missions. A high-ranking character might be able to 
call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, 
gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special 
missions to members of lower rank. 

Downtime Activities. You might allow characters 

to spend downtime between adventures building 
;elationships and gaining renown within an 
organization. For more information on downtime 
activities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures." 

L OSING RENOWN 
Disagreements with members of an organization 
a ren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that 
organization. However, serious offenses committed 
against the organization or its members can result 
in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. 
The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is 
left to your discretion. A character's renown within an 
organization can never drop below 0. 

PI ETY 
\Vith a few alterations, the renown system can also 
erve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's 
a great option for campaigns where the gods take active 
roles in the world. 

Using this approach, you track renown based on 
pecific divine figures in your campaign. Each character 
bas  the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with 
goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any 
renown he or she earns is called piety. A character 
gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their 
commands,. and respecting their taboos. A character 
loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring 
them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims. 
The gods bestow favors on those who prove their 

devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character 
can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually 
comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor 
often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for 
example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a 
pel!  accompanied by the boom of thunder. 
A high level of piety can also lead to a character 
gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a 
blessing or charm (see chapter 7,  "Treasure," for such 
upernatural gifts). 

MAGIC IN YouR WoRLD 
In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous 
and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know 
about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some 
point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves 
through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, 
the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched 
by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, 
and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. 
Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of 
those who wield it. 

What normal folk know of magic depends on where 

th.ey live and whether they know characters who 
practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not 
have seen true magic used for generations and speak 
in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit 
living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep 
in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order 
of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These 
arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the 
order's members can profit from selling their services. 

Some D&D settings have more magic in them than 

others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun 
setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain 
life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the 
hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, 
magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. 
Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to 

SAMPLE  FACTION: THE  ZHENTARIM 
The Zhentarim  (also  known  as the  Black  Network)  is  an 
unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand  its 
influence and  power throughout the Forgotten  Realms. 

The  public face  of the  Black  Network appears  relatively 

benign.  It offers the best and cheapest goods and  services, 
both  legal  and  illicit, thus destroying its  competitors and 
making everyone dependent on  it. 

A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself 
as a member of a very  large family  and  relies  on the  Black 
Network for  resources  and  security.  However,  members are 
granted the autonomy to pursue their own  interests and gain 
some measure of personal wealth  and  influence. As  a whole, 
the Zhentarim  promises "the best of the  best,"  although 
in  truth the organization is  more interested  in  spreading 
its own  propaganda and  influence than  investing in  the 
improvement of its  individual  members. 

Motto.  "join  us  and  prosper. Oppose us  and  suffer." 
Beliefs. The Zhentarim's  beliefs can  be  summarized 

as follows: 

•  The Zhentarim  is  your family.  You  watch  out for  it,  and  it 

watches out for you. 

•  You  are the master of your own  destiny.  Never be less than 

what you  deserve to be. 
Everything and  everyone  has a price. 

Goals. Amass wea lth,  power,  and  influence,  and  thereby 

dominate  Faerun. 

Typical Quests. Typical  Zhentarim quests include 

plundering or stealing a treasure hoard,  powerful  magic item , 
or artifact;  securing a lucrative  business contract or enforcing 
a preexisting one;  and  establishing a foothold  in  a place 
where the Zhentarim  holds little  sway.

anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to 
ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic. 

Consider these questions -when fitting magic into 

your world: 

Is some magic common? Is some socially 
unacceptable? Which magic is rare? 
How unusual are members of each spellcasting 
class? How common are those who can cast high(cid:173)
level spells? 
How rare are magic items, magical locations, 
and creatures that have supernatural powers? At 
what power level do these things go from everyday 
to exotic? 
How do authorities regulate and use magic? How 
do normal folks use magic and protect them(cid:173)
selves from it? 

The answers to  some questions suggest the answers 

to others. For example, if spell casters of low-level 
spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and 
common folk are more likely to have access to and use 
the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic 
isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are 
more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to 
protect against it, especially in risky situations. 

RESTRICTIONS  ON  MAGIC 
Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use 
of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a 
license or official permission. In such a place, magic 
items and continual magical effects are rare, with 
protections against magic being the exception. 

Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could 

be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, 
such as those that bestow invisibility or produce 
illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others 
are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of 
free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for 
obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about 
a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if 
he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact 
a law restricting that type of magic. 

SCHOOLS  OF  MAGIC 
The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic 
(abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's 
up to you to determine what those schools signify in 
your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the 
existence of magic-using organizations in the world(cid:173)
bardic colleges and druid circles- which are up to you to 
flesh out. 

· 

You could decide that no formal structures like these 

exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) 
might be so rare that a player character learns from a 
single mentor and never meets another character of the 
same class, in which case wizards would learn their 
school specialization without any formal training. 

However, if magic is more common, academies can 

be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These 
institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, 
regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros 
the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic 

CHAPTER 1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within 
its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green 
robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these 
robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who 
know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or 
a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome 
reputation. 

If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, 

bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, 
using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier 
in this chapter. A player character necromancer might 
cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while 
a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of 
Mac-Fuirmidh. 

TELEPORTATION  CIRCLES 
The presence of permanent teleportation circles in 
major cities helps cement their important place in the 
economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, 
teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these 
circles, which are found in  temples, academies, the 
headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent 
civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle 
is a possible means of entry into a city,  they're guarded 
by military and magical protection. 

As you design a fantasy city, think about the 

teleportation circles it might contain and which ones 
adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers 
commonly return to their home base by means of 
a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for 
plot developments in your campaign. What do the 
adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and 
find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying 
in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an 
.argument between two feuding priests at the temple? 
Adventure ensues! 

BRINGING BACK THE  DEAD 
When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 
the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, 
and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's 
deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its 
soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. 
Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving 
the soul from that plane and returning it to  its body. 

Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for 

a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping 
the body prevents others from using raise dead or 
resurrection to restore the slain character to  life. 

A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to 
be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron 
deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and 
might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if 
the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a 
high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs 
his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the 
dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him 
automatically fail.  If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm 
to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick 
his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him 
and then capturing him once he is alive again. 

CREATING A  CAMPAIGN 
The world you create is the stage for the 
adventures you set in it. You  don't have to  give more 
thought to  it than that. You  can run adventures in 
an episodic format , with the characters as the only 
common element, and also weave themes throughout 
those adventures to build a greater saga of the 
characters' achievements in the world. 

P lanning an entire campaign might seem like a 
daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every 
detail right from the start. You  can start with the 
basics, running a few adventures, and think about 
larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign 
progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail 
a  you wish. 

The start of a campaign resembles the start of an 
adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, 
how the players that adventure awaits, and grab 
their attention right away.  Give the players enough 
information to make them want to come back week after 

·eek to see how the story plays out. 

START SMALL 

\"hen you first start building your campaign, start 
-mall.  The characters need to know only about the 
city, town, or village where they start the game, and 
perhaps the nearby dungeon. You  might decide that 
the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a 
distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant 
piders, and you should note these things. But at 
the start of the game, the local area is enough to  get 
the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to 
create that local area: 

1.  CREATE A  HOME BASE 

ee the "S ettlements" section earlier in this chapter 

;"or guidance on building this settlement. A small 
·own or village at the edge of the wilderness serves 
a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use 

a la rger town or city if you want a campaign with 

rban adventuring. 

2.  CREATE A  LOCAL REGION 
- ee "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter 
:or guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1  hex= 
l  mile) with the home base near the center. Fill 
n the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 
:niles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to 
:our dungeons or similar adventure locales . 
. -ill area that size is likely to have one to three 
additional settlements as well as the home base, 
so give thought to them as well. 

3.  CRAFT A  STARTING ADVENTURE 

ingle dungeon makes a good first adventure 
'or most campaigns. See chapter 3, "Creating 
_ dventures,"  for guidance. 

A home base provides a common starting 

.ocation for the characters. This starting point 
might be the village where they grew up or a 
ci _- that attracted them from points beyond. 

Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons 
of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up 
for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing 
them into the midst of the adventure. 

For each of these steps, give the locations only as 
much detail as they need. You don't need to identify 
every building in a village or label every street in a large 
city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon , you'll 
need the details of this first adventure site, but you 
don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out 
a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and 
consider whom the characters are most likely to interact 
with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize 
how this area fits into the theme and story you have in 
mind for your campaign. Then start working on your 
first adventure! 

SET THE  STAGE 
As you start to develop your campaign, you'll need to 
fill  in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, 
compile essential information into a campaign 
handout. Such a handout typically includes the 
following material: 

Any restrictions or new options for character creation, 
such as new or prohibited races. 
Any information in the backs tory of your campaign 
that the characters would know about. If you have 
a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this 
information could include seeds hinting at that focus . 

•  Basic information about the area where the characters 

are starting, such as the name of the town, important 
locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd 
know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble 
that's brewing. 

Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages 
is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of 
creative energy that produces twenty pages of great 
background material, save it for your adventures. Let 
the players uncover the details gradually in play. 

INVOLVING THE  CHARACTERS 
Once you've identified what your campaign is about, 
let the players help tell the story by deciding how their 
characters are involved. This is their opportunity to 
tie their characters' history and background to the 
campaign, a nd a chance for you to determine how the 
various elements of each character's background tie 
into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has 
the hermit character learned? What is the status of the 
noble character's family? What is the folk hero's destiny? 

Some players might have trouble coming up with 

ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help 
spur their creativity with a few questions about their 
characters: 

Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, 
who's your family? What's your current occupation? 
•  Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? 

Why did you come to  this area? 

CHAPTER  I  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

Are you tied to any of the organizations or people 
involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are 
they friends or enemies? 

Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. 

Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in 
the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or 
a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. 
Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits 
your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign 
into that story. 

CREATING A  BACKGROUND 
Backgrounds are designed to root player characters 
in  the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great 
way to introduce players to the special features of your 
world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, 
organizations, and historical events from your campaign 
are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain 
religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, 
singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain 
and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant 
priest background (or modify the acolyte background) 
to reflect these qualities. It could include musical 
instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves 
receiving hospitality from the faithful. 

Guidelines for creating a new background are 

provided in chapter 9,  "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 

CAMPAIGN  EVENTS 
Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend 
toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces 
of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural 
disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions 
of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations 
of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the 
chapters of history. 

In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that 
can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common 
pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, mfddle, 
and end is inertia. Like many television shows and 
comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of 
retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's 
gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those 
other mediums, so can players- the actors and writers 
of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story 
meanders too long without a change in tone, when the 
same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and 
predictable, and when the world doesn't change around 
the characters and in response to their actions. 

World-shaking events force conflict. They set new 
events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes 
change the world by altering the tone of the setting 
in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your 
world in big, bold print. Change- especially change that 
occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the 
story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions 
of the characters lack significance. When the world 
becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up. 

PuTTING EvENTS  IN  MoTION 
World-shaking events can happen at any time in 
a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents 
naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end 
of a story. 

--------

That placement reflects the structure of dramatic 

stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens 
to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into 
action. The characters take action to resolve their 
problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a 
significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict 
disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world 
again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, 
they succeed or fail , and the world is shaken again by 
the way the characters changed it for good or ill. 

At the beginning of a D&D campaign, world-shaking 

events create instant adventure hooks and affect the 
characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great 
turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse(cid:173)
rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near 
the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent 
climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might 
even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the 
characters' actions. 

WHEN  NoT To  SHAKE  IT UP -----

In constructing a narrative, beware of "false action," 
or action for its own sake. False action doesn't move 
a story forward , engage characters, or cause them to 
change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in 
which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but 
do little more than inconvenience the characters and 
eventually bore the audience with their repetition and 
dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall 
into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters 
together one after another with little impact on the 
characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the 
DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time 
there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events 
become ordinary. 

As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to 

three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the 
beginning, one near the middle, and one near the 
end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the 
bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, 
duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every 
significant event shakes someone's ·world, after all, no 
matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected 
a nd terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller 
territories, but unless your story demands it, save the 
large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most 
important moments of your campaign.

You can use this section for ideas and inspiration to 
expand on world-shaking events already occurring (or 
oon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can 
roll  on the tables below to randomly generate an event

1-2.  RISE  OR FALL OF A  LEADER OR AN  ERA 
Eras are often defined by the prominent leaders, 
innovators, and tyrants of th e day. These people change 
the world and etch their signatures indelibly on the 
pages of history. When they rise to power, they s hape 
the time and place where they live in  monumental ways. 
When they fall  from power or pass away, the ghost of 
their presence lingers. 

Determine the kind of leader th at influences the new 

or passing era. You can choose the type of leader or 
determine one randomly using the Leader Types table.

Political leaders are monarchs, nobles, and chiefs. 

Religious leaders include deities' avatars, high priests, 
and messiahs, as well as those in  cha rge of monasteries 
and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military 
leaders control the armed forces of countries. They 
include military dictators, warlords, and the heads of 
a ruler's war council. Minor military leaders include 
the heads of local militias, ga ngs, and other martial 
organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or 
underworld leader wields power th rough a network of 
spies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest 
scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and 
brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose 
work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way 
people think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool 
in whose words, art, or performance the people perceive 
universal truth . On a smaller scale, this  might be an 
influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. 
A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is 
a genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an 
enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution 
of learning in the world, or an archmage.  A minor leader 

CHAPTER 1  I A WORLD  OF  YOUR  OWN 

?..7 

might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder, 
or teacher. 

Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era. In dramatic 

stories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of 
a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war 
or uprising; other times it's an election, the death of a 
tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. 
Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend , or 
black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could 
have been one of peace, tranquility, and justice. 

A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign 

world and begins a new era in the selected region. How 
does this person or this era begin to affect the world? 
Here are several things to consider when determining 
the leader's impact on the world: 

•  Name one thing that has been consistently true about 

the world, which is now no longer true due to this 
leader's rise or influence. This is the biggest change 
that occurs when the new leader takes power and 
becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the 
characteristic for which it is remembered. 

•  Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or 

loss opened the door for this leader to  take power. 
This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of 
old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who 
died, lost, or was defeated? What weren't they willing 
to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in 
the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity 
serendipitous? 

•  Despite the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular 
outrages a certain segment of the populace. What 
is that flaw? What person or group of persons will 
do their utmost to foil  this leader because of it? 
Conversely, what is this leader's greatest virtue, and 
who rises to the leader's defense because of it? 

•  Who believes in this leader now, but still retains 

doubts? This is someone close to  the leader, who has 
the leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears, 
doubts, or vices. 
FaJJ of a Leader, End of an Era. All  that begins must 
end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the 
world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become 
all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude 
of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at 
first and then changes dramatically as they look back or 
reminisce about the time before . 

The fallen leader might have been a benevolent 

ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the 
characters. How does the death of this person affect 
those formerly under his or her influence? ijere are 
several things to consider when determining the effects 
of a leader's passing: 

•  Name one positive change that the leader brought to 
his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that 
change persist after the leader's death? 
State the general mood or attitude of the people under 
this person's power. What important fact didn't they 
realize about this person or his or her reign, which 
will later come to light? 
Name one person or group that tries to fill  the leader's 
shoes in the resulting power vacuum. 

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

Name one person or group that plotted against 
this leader. 
Name three things for which this leader will be 
remembered. 

3.  CATACLYSMIC  DISASTER 
Earthquake, famin e, fire, plague, flood- disasters on a 
grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without 
warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw 
maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes 
the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago 
Fire, for instance, provided a n opportunity to rebuild 
the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time 
the disaster leaves only ruins- buried under ash like 
Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis. 
You  ca n choose the cataclysm or determine one 

randomly us ing the Cataclysmic Disasters table.

Some of the disasters on the table might not make 

immediate sense in the context of your campaign 
world. A flood  in the desert? A volcanic eruption on 
grassy plains? If you  randomly determine a disaster 
that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the 
challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce 
interesting results. 

With two exceptions, the disasters on the table 
resemble those that affect our own world. Think 
of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear 
incidents; they're big events that unn atu ra lly alter 
the land and its people. For example,  in the Eberron 
campa ign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste 
to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile 
wasteland and ending the Las t War. 

Divine judgment is something else entirely. This 

disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a 
big,  bold, uns ubtle sign of a deity's displeasure. 

You  might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off 
the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and 
effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. 
Leave one or two survivors to  tell the characters what 
happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth 
of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this 
cataclysm? The following points can help you define the 
nature and consequences of the disaster: 

•  Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it 

originated. 

•  An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and 

omens. Describe the omen in detail. 

•  Describe or name the creature that warned the 

populace about the oncoming disaster. Who listened? 
ho were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who survived? 

•  Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in 

contrast to  how it looked before. 

~. ASSAULT OR INVASION 

ne of the most common world-shaking events, an 
Yasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over 

.another, usually by military strength, but also by 
.nfiltration and occupation. 

An assault differs from an invasion in that the 
acking force isn't necessarily interested in  occupation 
r taking power. On the other hand, an assau lt  might be 
e first step of an invasion. 
Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or 
vasion stands out because its repercussions change 
e characters' world, and its effects echo long after the 

.nitial attack or takeover. 

Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked 
r invaded. Depending on the current scale of your 
ampaign, the area might be as small as a section 
of a city or as large as a continent, world, or plane of 
existence. 

Define the aggressor and whether it represents a 
..mown enemy or a previously unknown adversary. 
-elect a threat that already poses a danger to the area 
_·ou've chosen, or use the Invading Forces table to 
determine the aggressor.

Invading Force 
A criminal enterprise 
Monsters or a unique monster 
A planar threat 
A past adversary reawakened,  reborn, or resurgent 
A splinter faction 
A savage  tribe 
A secret society 
A traitorous ally 

Now consider these other aspects of the conflict: 

Name one element of the invasion or assault that the · 
defenders didn't expect or couldn't repel. 
Something happened to the first defenders who stood 
against the invasion or assault-something no one 
wants to talk about. What was it? 

•  The attackers or invaders had a motive for their 
action that wasn't obvious or understood at first. 
What was it? 

•  Who turned traitor, and at what point did they turn? 

Why did they do it? Did an attacker try to stop the 
incursion, or did a prominent defender throw in with 
the invaders? 

5.  REBELLION,  REVOLUTION,  OVERTHROW 
Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group 
of people overturns the dominant regime and takes 
over-or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a 
revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny 
of nations. 

The scale of a revolution need not involve the common 
masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small 
as a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership 
or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a 
new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to 
overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that 
cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be 
as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods. 

CHAPTER 1  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

29 

Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in 

revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign 
and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting 
revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh 
out the conflict: 

Name three things the rebels want or hope to achieve. 

•  The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish 
to  overthrow, even if it's a pyrrhic victory. Which of 
their three goals do they achieve? How long is this 
achievement likely to  last? 
State the cost exacted upon the old order after its 
fall  from power. Does anyone from the former power 
group remain in  power during the next regime? If the 
old order remains in power, describe one way that its 
leaders punish the revolutionaries. 

•  One of the rebellion's prominent leaders-in some 
respects the face of the revolution- was driven by a 
personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe 
this person and state the true reason he or she led the 
rebellion. 

•  What problem existed before the revolution that 

persists in spite of it? 

6. EXTINCTION  OR DEPLETION 
Something that once existed in the campaign world 
is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, 
a species of plant or animal that held an important 
place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of 
people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects 
every creature that uses or relies on it. 

You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that 

previously existed in a certain location or area in your 
campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family 
. dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town 
in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a 
grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the 
final fey noble departs the world. 

What is gone from the world-or the region of the 
world you've chosen- that once existed there? If the 
answer isn't immediately evident, consult the Extinction 
or Depletion table for ideas.

A type of monster (unicorn, manticore, dragon) 
A people  (family line, clan,  culture,  race) 
A kind of plant (crop, tree,  herb, forest) 
A waterway  (river,  lake, ocean) 

Then consider these additional questions: 

Name a territory, race, or type of creature that relied 
on the thing that was lost. How do they compensate? 
How do they attempt to substitute for what was lost? 

Who or what is to blame for the loss? 
Describe an immediate consequence of the loss. 
Forecast one way that the loss impacts or changes 
the world in the long term. Who or what suffers the 
most as a result of the loss? Who or what benefits the 
most from it? 

7. NEW ORGANIZATION 
The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion, 
society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its 
actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local 
scale, a new organization contends with existing power 
groups, influencing, subverting, dominating, or allying 
with them to create a stronger base of power. Large 
and powerful organizations can exert enough influence 
to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the 
populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization 
they once protected. 

Perhaps an important new organization arises in one 

part of your world. It could have humble or auspicious 
beginnings, but one thing is certain: it is destined to 
change the world as long as it progresses along its 
present course. Sometimes an organization's alignment 
is apparent from inception, but its morality can remain 
ambiguous until its doctrines, policies, and traditions 
are revealed over time. Choose the type of organization, 
or use the New Organizations table to generate ideas. 

NEW  ORGANIZATIONS

Then consider some or all of the following options: 

The new order supplants a current power group in 
the world, gaining territory, converts, or defectors and 
reducing the previous power group's numbers. Who or 
what does the foundation of this new order supplant? 
The new order appeals to a specific audience. Decide 
whether this order attracts a certain race, social class, 
or character class. 
The leader of this new order is known for a particular 
quality valued by his or her followers.  Elaborate on 
why they respect him or her for this quality, and 
what actions this leader has taken to retain the 
followers' support. 
A rival group opposes the foundation of this new 
organization. Choose an existing power group from 
your campaign to oppose the new organization, or 
create one from the categories on the table. Decide 
why they oppose the new group, who leads them, and 
what they plan to  do to stop their rival. 

8. DISCOVERY,  EXPANSION ,  INVENTION 
Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change 
the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic 
or technology expand the boundaries of what was once 
thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds 
create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and 
power groups in motion to vie for their control. 

A new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact your 

campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the 
course of history and the events of the age. Think of this 
discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. 
This is also an opportunity to  create a unique monster, 
item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the 
discovery matters, it doesn't have to be wholly original, 
just flavored for your campaign. 

A discovery is particularly impressive when the 

adventurers in your campaign are the ones who 
make it. If they discover a new mineral with magical 
properties, map a new land that's eminently suitable 
for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with 
the power to wreak devastation on your world, they 
are likely to set major events in motion. This gives 
the players the opportunity to see exactly how much 
influence their actions have on your world. 

Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use 

the Discoveries table to generate ideas.

Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh 

it out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered 
it, and what potential effect it could have on the 
world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign 
will help you fill  in the blanks, but also keep the 
following in mind: 

This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or 
faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name 
three benefits they stand to  gain from this discovery. 
This discovery directly harms another person, group, 
or faction. Who is harmed the most? 

•  This discovery has consequences. Name three 
repercussions or side effects. Who ignores the 
repercussions? 
Name two or three individuals or factions struggling 
to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to 
win? What do they stand to gain, and what are they 
willing to do to control the discovery?

9. PREDICTION'  OMEN'  PROPHECY 
Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event 
becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts 
the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end 
of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change 
for the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero 
or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of 
future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other 
world-shaking events, the outcome doesn't happen 
immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to 
fulfill  or avert the prophecy-or shape the exact way it 
will be fulfilled- according to how it will affect them. 
The prophecy's helpers or hinderers create adventure 
hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A 
prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, 
since it will take time to  come true (or be averted). 

Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to  light. 
If events continue on their present course, the prophecy 
will come true and the world will change dramatically 
as a result. Don't shy away from making this prophecy 
both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the 
following points: 

Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to 
the campaign world. You can build one from scratch 
using ideas from the current campaign or randomly 
determine a world-shaking event and fl~sh out 
the details. 
Write a list of three or more omens that will occur 
before the prophecy comes to pass. You  can use 
events that have already occurred in the campaign so 
that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest 
are events that might or might not happen, depending 
on the actions of the characters. 
Describe the person or creature that discovered 
the prophecy and how it was found. What did this 
creature gain by revealing it? What did this person 
lose or sacrifice? 

•  Describe the individual or faction that supports the 

prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the 
one that will do all in its power to  avert the prophecy. 
What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for 
their efforts? 
One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the 
omens you listed or one of the details you created for 
the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The 
chosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is 
true instead. 

10. MYTH AND  LEGEND 
If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called 
regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed 
and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the 
fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it 
might be an act of divine intervention. 

Once again, your current campaign probably provides 

a few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need 
inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, 
instead of the normal dlO. Address the bullet-point 
notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to  the 
grandest scale you can imagine. 

CHAPTER 1  j  A  WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

The rise or fall  of a leader or era is the death or 
birth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A 
cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice 
age, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is 
a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the 
awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final 
clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a 
god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon 
lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning 
empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a 
doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions 
where world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell. 

TRACKING TIME 
A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the 
campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for 
the critical events that shake up the world. For simple 
time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in 
the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the 
campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers 
spend on their travels and various activities. The 
calendar tells you when the seasons change and 
the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your 
calendar to  track important festivals and holidays, as 
well as key events that shape your campaign. 

This method is a good starting point, but the calendar 
of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you 
want to customize your calendar with details unique to 
your world, consider these types of features. 

THE BASICS 
A fantasy world's calendar doesn't have to mirror the 
modern one, but it can (see "The Calendar of Harptos" 
sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have 
names? What about specific days of each month, like the 
ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar? 

PHYSICAL CYCLES 
Determine when the seasons fall , marked by the 
solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond 
to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange 
and magical effects occur at the same time as these 
phenomena? 

RELIGIOUS  OBSERVANCES 
Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each 
significant deity in your world should have at least one 
holy day during the year, and some gods' holy days 
correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons 
or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a 
god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or 
significant events in the history of the deity's worship, 
such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of 
a god's  manifestation, the accession of the current high 
priest, and so on. 

Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every 

citizen of a town where a god's temple can be found. 
Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand 
scale. Other holy days are important only to people 
particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are 
observed by priests, who perform private rites and 
sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific 

times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by 
dle fa ithful of a specific temple. 

Give some thought to how priests and common folk 

-elebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a 
pew, a nd listening to a sermon is a mode of worship 
"oreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, 
celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful 
bri ng animals to the temple to be slaughtered or 
urn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens 
ori ng the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and 
emonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the 
graves of their ancestors. They spend a ll-night vigils in 
darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a 
god's bounty. 

C IVIC  OBSERVANCES 
Holy days provide the majority of the special 
celebrations in most calendars, but local or national 
:estivals account for many others. The birthday of a 
:nonarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, 
craft  festivals , market days, and similar events all 
;>rovide excuses for local celebrations. 

f ANTASTIC  EVENTS 
-ince your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane 
::nedieval society, add in a few events of an obviously 
magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle 
appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every 
_·ear,  or every third full  moon fills  lycanthropes with a 
particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night 
of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a 
ong-forgotten nomadic tribe. 

Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet 

or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and 
:ou can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. 
Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for 
a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a 
articular effect. 

EN DING A  CAMPAIGN 
A campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of 
beginning and middle, but you don't have to take a 

campaign all the way to 20th level for it to  be satisfying. 
.\'rap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its 
atural conclusion. 
:Make sure you allow space and time near the end 
of your campaign for  the characters to finish up any 
personal goals. Their own stories need to  end in 
a  atisfying way, just as the campaign story does. 
deally, some of the characters' individual goals will be 
:ulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give 
haracters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them 
before the very end. 

Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. 
f you intend to run a new campaign for the same group 
of players, using their previous characters' actions as 
r.he basis of legends gives them immediate investment in 
dle new setting. Let the new characters experience how 
me world has changed because of their old characters. 
n the end, though, the new campaign is a new story

-potlight with the heroes of days gone by. 

The world  of the  Forgotten  Realms  uses the Calendar of 
Harptos,  named after the long-dead wizard who  invented 
it.  Each  year of 365 days  is  divided  into twelve  months of 
thirty days  each, which  roughly correspond to  months  in  the 
real-world  Gregorian calendar.  Each  month  is  divided  into 
three tendays.  Five  special  holidays fall  between the months 
and  mark the seasons. Another special  holiday,  Shieldmeet, 
is  inserted  into the calendar after Midwinter every four years, 
much  like  leap yea rs  in  the modern Gregorian calendar.

CHAPTER  l  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN

PLAY STYLE 
By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) 
and creating the key events that launch your campaign, 
you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you 
have to  decide how you want to run your campaign. 

What's the right way to run a campaign? That depends 

on your play style and the motivations of your players. 
Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a 
DM,  table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of 
game you want to run. Describe to the players how you 
envision the game experience and let them give you 
input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork 
early, so your players can make informed choices and 
help you maintain the type of game you want to run. 

Consider the following two exaggerated examples of 

play style. 

HACK AND  SLASH 
The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the 
monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is 
straightforward, fun , exciting, and action-oriented. The 
players spend relatively little time developing personas 
for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations, 
or discussing anything other than the immediate 
dangers of the dungeon. 

In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil 

monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly 
good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers 
to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to  debate 
whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a 
bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town. 
Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers 
back into the action as quickly as possible. Character 
motivation need be no more developed than a desire to 
kill monsters and acquire treasure. 

lMMERSIVE  STORYTELLING 
Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The 
adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's 
secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so 

A WORLD TO  EXPLORE 
Much  of a campaign  involves the adventurers traveling from 
place to place, exploring the environment, and  learning 
about the fantasy world . This exploration can take  place in 
any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine 
dungeon, the shadowy  passages of the  Underdark, the 
crowded streets of a city,  and the undulating waters of 
the sea.  Determining a way around  an  obstacle, finding  a 
hidden object,  investigating a strange feature  of a dungeon , 
deciphering clues,  solving puzzles,  and  bypassing or 
disabling traps can  all  be  part of exploration. 

Sometimes exploration  is  an  incidental  part of the game. 
For instance, you  might gloss over an  unimportant journey 
by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days 
on the road  before moving along to the next  point of interest. 
Other times exploration  is  the focus,  a chance to describe 
a wondrous  part of the world  or story that increases the 
players' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you  should consider 
playing up  exploration  if your players enjoy solving  puzzles, 
finding their way around obstacles, and  searching dungeon 
corridors for secret doors. 

,. 

only after both the characters and the lords have come 
to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. 
This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. 
The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political 
maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game 
session might pass without a single attack roll. 

In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and 
richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus 
lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. 
Expect long digressions from each player about what 
his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to 
ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter 
as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to 
fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do 
so.) A character will sometimes take actions against 
the player's better judgment, because "that's what the 
character would do." 

Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back 
seat to character development. Ability check modifiers 
and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat 
bonuses. Feel free to  change or ignore rules to fit  the 
players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in 
part 3 of this book. 

SOMETHING IN BETWEEN 
The style of play in most campaigns falls between these 
two extremes. There's plenty of action, but the campaign 
offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between 
characters as well. Players develop their characters' 
motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills 
in combat. To  maintain the balance, provide a mixture 
of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even 
in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't 
meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated 
with, or just talked to. 

Think about your preferred style of play by 

considering these questions: 

•  Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or 
are you more focused on making the game seem like 
an action movie? 

•  Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval 
fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines 
or modern thinking? 
Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor 
your goal? 

•  Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted 

or intense? 

•  Is bold action key,  or do the players need to be 

thoughtful and cautious? 
Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you 
prefer improvising on the spot? 

•  Is the game full of varied D&D elements, or does it 

center on a theme such as horror? 

•  Is the game for all ages, or does it involve 

mature themes? 
Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as 
allowing the characters to explore whether the end 
justifies the means? Or are you happier with straight(cid:173)
forward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, 
and helping the downtrodden? 

CHAPTER  1  I A  WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

34 

CHARACTER NAMES 
Part of your campaign style has to do with naming 
characters. It's a good idea to establish some ground 
rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. 
In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, 
and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, 
especially when he's identical to Bob I, who was killed 
by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach 
to names, that's fine. If the group would rather take the 
characters and their names a little more seriously, urge 
Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name. 

Player character names should match each other 
in flavor or concept, and they should also match the 
flavor of your campaign world-so should the non player 
characters' names and place names you create. Travok 
and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for Lord 
Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy 
wizard named Ray. 

CONTINUING OR 
EPISODIC  CAMPAIGNS 
The backbone of a campaign is a connected series 
of adventures, but you can connect them in two 
different ways. 

In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures 

share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring 
theme (or themes). The adventures might feature 
returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single 
mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure 
of the campaign. 

A continuing campaign designed with a theme and 
a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. 
The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the 
actions they take during one adventure matter in the 
next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can 
be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and 
memorable story. 

An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television 

show where each week's episode is a self-contained 
story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It 
might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the 
player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers 
venturing into the unknown and facing a string of 
unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, 
venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search 
of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create 
adventures-or buy published ones- and drop them into 
your campaign without worrying about how they fit with 
the adventures that came before and follow after. 

CAMPAIGN THEME 
A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, 
expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the 
fundamental elements of human experience that the 
story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work 
of literature, but it can still draw on common themes 
that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider 
these examples: 

CHAPTER  I  I A WORLD  OF YOUR  OWN 

A campaign about confronting the inevitability of 
mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or 
expressed through the death of loved ones. 
A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, 
whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the 
yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed 
from mortal concerns. As  heroes confront this evil, 
they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own 
kind as well. 
A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront 
not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the 
world, but also the beast within- the rage and fury 
that lies in their own hearts. 
A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power 
and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the 
Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering 
the world. 

With a theme such as "confrontation with mortality," 

you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't 
necessarily connected by a common villain. One 
adventure might feature the dead bursting from their 
graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. 
In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh 
golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could 
go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid 
confronting its own demise. The adventurers might 
help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the 
adventurers might even become a ghost! 

VARIATIONS  ON A  THEME 
Mixing things up once in a while allows your players 
to  enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed 
campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign 
heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your 
players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl(cid:173)
especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to  a larger 
plot irr the campaign. If most of your adventures are 
dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban 
mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon 
crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run 
horror adventures week after week, try using a villain 
who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic 
relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign, 
though players usually provide it themselves. 

TIERS  OF  PLAY 
As characters grow in power, their ability to change the 
world around them grows with them. It helps to think 
ahead when creating your campaign to account for this 
change. As the characters make a greater impact on the 
world, they face greater danger whether they want to 
or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot 
against them, while friendly ones court their favor in 
hopes of striking a useful alliance. 

The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for 

introducing new world-shaking events to  the campaign. 
As the characters resolve one event, a new danger 
arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat 
in response to the characters' actions. Events.need to 
grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and 
drama as the characters become increasingly powerful. 

This approach also allows you to break your design 
work down into smaller pieces. Create material such 
as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at 
a time. You only need to worry about the details of the 
next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as 
the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the 
players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing 
much work. 
LEVELS  1- 4:  LOCAL HEROES 
Characters in this tier are still learning the range of 
class features that define them, including their choice 
of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are 
heroes, set apart from the common people by natural 
characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater 
destiny that lies before them. 

At the start of their careers, characters use 1st-

a nd 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The 
magic items they find  include common consumable 
items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon 
permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in 
a single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an 
adventure. 

The fate of a village might hang on the success or 
failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives 
to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate 
dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where 
they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, 
giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and 
hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're 
better off avoiding a fight. 
LEVELS  5-10:  HEROES  OF THE  REALM 
By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have 
mastered the basics of their class features , though they 
continue to improve throughout these levels. They have 
found their place in the world and have begun to involve 
themselves in the dangers that surround them. 

Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the 
start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly,  damage 
large numbers of foes with fireball and lightning bolt 
pells, and even breathe underwater. They master 
5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such 
as teleportation circle, scrying, flame strike, legend 
lore, and raise dead can have a significant impact on 
their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent 
magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which 
will serve them for the rest of their careers. 

The fate of a region might depend on the adventures 

that characters of levels 5 to  10 undertake. These 
adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient 
ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious 
hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, 
bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers , and drow 
assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a 
young dragon that has established a lair but not yet 
extended its reach far into the surrounding territory. 

LEVELS  11-16:  MASTERS  OF THE 
REALM 
By 11th level, characters are shining examples of 
courage and determination-true paragons in the world, 
set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers 
are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and 
they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge. 
Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells 

at 11th level, including spells that completely change 
the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, 
flashy spells are significant in combat- disintegrate , 
blade barrier, and heal, for example- but behind-the(cid:173)
scenes spells such as word of recall, find the path, 
contingency, teleport, and true seeing alter the way 
players approach their adventures. Each spell level after 
that point introduces new effects with an equally large 
impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very 
rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities. 
The fate  of a nation or even the world depends on 
momentous quests that such characters undertake. 
Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into 
long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible 
masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas 
and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might 
encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon 
that has established a lair and a significant presence in 
the world. 

At  this tier, adventurers make their mark on the 

world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of 
their adventures to the manner in which they spend 
their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved 
reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses 
on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, 
temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices 
or students of their own. They broker peace between 
nations or lead them into war. And their formidable 
reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes. 
LEVELS  17-20:  MASTERS  OF THE 
WORLD 
By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities, 
and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. 
Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of 
power-or such terrible dangers. 

Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 
9th-level spells such as wish, gate, storm of vengeance, 
and astral projection. Characters have several rare 
and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin 
discovering legendary items such as a vorpal sword or a 
staff of the magi. 

Adventures at these levels have far-reaching 
consequences, possibly determining the fate of 
millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. 
Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore 
demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they 
fight savage bator demons, titans, archdevils, lich 
archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. 
The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous 
power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose 
waking threatens existence itself. 

CHAPTER  l  I A WORLD  OF YOUR OWN 

37 

Characters who reach 20th level have attained 

the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are 
recorded in the annals of history and recounted by 
bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to 
pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to 
serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become 
a patron to  other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks 
the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons 
exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid 
might become one with the land, transforming into a 
nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the 
wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties 
that revere the memory of their honored ancestors 
from generation to generation, create masterpieces of 
epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands 
of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the 
adventurers' principles and dreams alive. 

Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the 

end of the campaign. These powerful characters might 
be called on to undertake grand adventures on the 
cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their 
capabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no 
more levels at this point, but they can still advance in 
meaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds 
that resound throughout the multiverse. Chapter 7 
details epic boons you can use as rewards for these 
characters to maintain a sense of progress. 
STARTING AT  HIGHER LEVEL -----
Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of 
the character classes and impatient for more significant 
adventures might welcome the idea of starting a 
campaign with characters above 1st level.  Creating a 
higher-level character uses the same character creation 
steps outlined in the Player's Handbook.  Such a 
character has more hit points, class features, and spells, 
and probably starts with better equipment. 

Starting equipment for characters above 1st level is 
entirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure 
at your own pace. That said, you can use the Starting 
Equipment table as a guide. 

FLAVORS  OF  FANTASY 
DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS is a fantasy game, but that broad 
category encompasses a lot of variety. Many different 
flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film.  Do you want 
a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. 
Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a 
world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along 
the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by 
Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can 
have a impact on the flavor of your campaign. 

~~------------------

HEROIC  FANTASY 
Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D 
rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline: 
a multitude of humanoid races coexist with huma ns in 
fantasti c worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to 
bear against the monstrous threats they face.  These 
characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, 
but something impels them into an adventuring life. The 
adventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but they 
might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for 
selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on 
medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily 
European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into 
ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to 
destroy monsters or villains. 

This genre is also common in fantasy fiction.  Most 

novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as 
heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the 
authors listed in appendix E of the Player's  Handbook. 

SwoRD AND  SoRCERY 
A grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest 
of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue 
spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. 
Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in 
search of the fabled City of Golden Masks. 

A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the 

classic works of fantasy fiction , a tradition that goes 
back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find  a dark, 
gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where

DARK FANTASY 
Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed 
castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create 
horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the 
innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these 
elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre. 
If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, 

you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster 
Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline 
of supernatural horror. The most important element of 
such a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules. A 
dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building 
dread, created through careful pacing and evocative 
description. Your players contribute too; they have to 
be willing to embrace the mood you're trying to  evoke. 
Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy 
campaign or a single creepy adventure, you should 
discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to 
make sure they're on board. Horror can be intense 
and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with 
such a game. 

Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the 

Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a 
D&D context. 

INTRIGUE 
The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron's oldest 
daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army 
sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the 
invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court 
makes contact with his employer. 

Political intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar 
cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for 
an exciting D&D campaign. In this kind of game, the 
characters might care more about skill training and 
making contacts than about attack spells and magic 
weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on 
greater importance than combat, and the party might go 
for several sessions without seeing a monster. 

Again, make sure your players know ahead of time 

that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, 
a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, 
only to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats 
and tiefling spies. 

The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M.  Evans focus 

on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the 
backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested 
s_uccession of Cormyrean royalty. 

MYSTERY 
Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them 
away in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their 
location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, 
and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered 
the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the 
guild's locked vault? 

A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in 
the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town 
to  town to  crack tough cases the local authorities can't 
handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and 
problem-solving in addition to combat prowess. 

A larger mystery might even set the stage for the 

whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters' 
mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who 
really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, 
the characters might uncover clues to the greater 
mystery only once in a while; individual adventures 
might be at best tangentially related to  that theme. A 
diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so 
be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present. 

Novels in various D&D settings have explored the 

mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, Murder 
in Cormyr (by Chet Williamson), Murder in Halruaa (by 
Richard S. Meyers), and Spellstorm (by Ed Greenwood) 
are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. Murder 
in Tarsis (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same 
approach in the Dragonlance setting. 

SWASHBUCKLING 
Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. 
Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to  devour treasure 
hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave 
their way through palace intrigues and leap from 
balconies onto waiting horses below. 

The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and 
musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic 
campaign. The characters typically spend more 
time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels 
than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills 
important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue 
campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in 
classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm 
sewers beneath the palace to  find  the evil duke's 
hidden chambers. 

A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the 

Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in 
novels by Richard Baker (City of Ravens and Prince 
of Ravens). 

WAR 
A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading 
elephants and giants to  batter down the stronghold's 
walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a barbarian 
horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors 
cut a swath through field and forest. Salamanders 
muster at an efreeti's command, poised to assault an 
astral fortress .

CROSSING THE  STREAMS 
The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of 
Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game 
products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth's 
Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped 
to  his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon 
belonging to  Greyhawk's god of justice, found its way 
to  the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in  1985. 
Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage 
of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien 
lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And 
the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms 
has been said to make occasional appearances in the 
kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood- where he is 
sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth 
an,d Krynn (homeworld of the Dragon lance saga). 

Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science 

fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might 
draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your 
characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis 
Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling 
between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future 
world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist 
side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter 
9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop," provides tools for 
exploring those possibilities.

- -e rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to  the 

.,-erial Plane. 

l: ..... A. NAR  CATEGORIES 

- -e planes of the default D&D cosmology are grouped 
- -:he following categories: 

e Material Plane and Its Echoes. The Feywild and 
··  e Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane. 
e Transitive Planes. The Ethereal Plane and the 
. ·  tral Plane are mostly featureless planes that 
:  rve primarily as pathways to  travel from one plane 
•o another. 

The Inner Planes. The four Elemental Planes (Air, 

Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that 
surrounds them, are the Inner Planes. 

The Outer Planes. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond 

to  the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of 
philosophical difference between them. 

The Positive and Negative Planes. These two planes 

enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw 
forces of life and death that underlie the rest of 
existence in the multiverse. 

PUTTING THE  PLANES TOGETHER 
As described in the Player's Handbook, the assumed 
D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. 
For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, 
inspired by the standard planes, drawn from  Earth's 
myths, or created by your own imagination. 

At  minimum, most D&D campaigns require 

these elements: 

•  A pla ne of origin for fiends 

A plane of origin for  celestials 
A plane of origin for elementals 

•  A place for deities, which might include any or all of 

the previous three 
The place where mortal spirits go  after death, which 
might include any or all of the first three 
A way of getting from one plane to another 
A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral 
Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function 

Once you've  decided on the planes you want to  use in 
your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology 
is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling 
from plane to  plane, even using the Transitive Planes, 
is through magical portals that link planes together, the 
exact relationship of different planes to one another is 
largely a theoretical concern. No  being in the multiverse 
can look down and see the planes in their arrangement 
the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No 
mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched 
between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient 
theoretical construct based on the philosophical 
shading among the three planes and the relative 
importance they give to law and good. 

Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models 

to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the 
Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great 

INVENTING  YOUR  OWN  PLANES 
Each  of the planes described  in  this chapter has at least 
one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When 
you  design your own  planes,  it's  a good  idea to stick to 
that model. Create one simple trait that players  notice, that 
doesn't create too much complication at the gaming table, 
and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and 
mood of the place, not merely  its  physical characteristics. 

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING A  MULT!VERSE

Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you 
can create or adapt whatever model works best for the 
planes you want to use in your game. 

THE  GREAT WHEEL 
The default cosmological arrangement presented 
in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a 
group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane 
and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form 
a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in  the 
Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another 
wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, 
arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands 
linking them all. 

This arrangement makes sense of the way the River 

Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting 
Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the 
Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's 
not the only possible explanation of the river's course. 

THE WORLD TREE 
A different arrangement of planes envisions them 
situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic 
tree, literally or figuratively. 

For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the 
World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World 
Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane 
that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other 
regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim 
(the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard 
and Midgard. 

Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities 

of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of 
celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while 
the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. 
Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these 
planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, 
though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish 
creatures. 

THE WORLD AxiS 
In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its 
echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral 
Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any 
number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below 
the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, 
undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements 
clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is 
the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos. 

OTHER VISIONS 
As you build your own cosmology, consider the 
following alternatives. 

The Omniverse. This simple cosmology covers the 

bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; 
a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good(cid:173)
aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, 
where evil deities and fiends live. 

Myriad Planes. In this cosmology, countless planes 

clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each 
other more or less at random. 

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  Mt.:LTI\ ERSE 

The Orrery. All  the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the 
Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on 
the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of 
Eberron uses this cosmological model. 

The Winding Road. In this cosmology, every plane is 

a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to 
two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between 
adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of 
Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna. 

Mount Olympus. In the Greek cosmology, Mount 

Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material 
Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another 
plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All 
the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains 
within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal 
souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually 
fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are 
imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And 
far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane 
are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes 
reside there. 

Solar Barge. The Egyptian cosmology is defined by 

the daily path of the sun- across the sky of the Material 
Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, 
where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, 
and then beneath the world through the nightmarish 
Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer 
Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral 
Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages 
of its journey. 

One World.  In this model, there are no other 

planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes 
places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount 
Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of 
Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the 
wodd, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though 
extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail 
across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium. 

The Otherworld. In this model, the Material Plane 

has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. 
Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane 
and can be reached through "thin places" where the 
worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing 
far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It 
has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), 
sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the 
blessed death), and realms of elemental fury.  This 
otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or 
by four cities that each represent a different aspect of 
reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called 
Tfr na n6g, and the cosmologies of some religions 
inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World. 

PLANAR TRAVEL 
When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, 
they undertake a legendary journey that might force 
them to face supernatural guardians and undergo 
various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials 
along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and 
whether the adventurers find  a magic portal or use a 
spell to carry them. 

"PLANAR PORTALS

Random. A random portal functions for a random 
period, then shuts down for a similarly random 
duration. Typically,  such a portal allows ld6 + 
6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down 
for  ld6 days. 

Command Word. The portal functions only if a 

particular command word is spoken.  Sometimes the 
word must be spoken as a character passes through 
the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, 
window, or similar opening). Other portals open when 
the command word is spoken and remain open for a 
short time. 

Key. The portal functions if the traveler is holding a 
particular object; the item acts much like a key to 
ll. door. This key item can be a common object or a 
particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil 
above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors 
because it features an overwhelming number of such 
item-keyed portals. 

Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can 

draw characters into further adventures as they chase 
down a key item, scour old libraries for command 
words, or consult sages to find  the right time 
to visit the portal.

SPELLS 

Sa~ya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of 
a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, 
a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes 
and create a magical bridge into another realm  of existence. 
The  myth a/ thrummed in  response, th e intangible pulse of 
the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya 
ignored the myth a/ stone's change and pressed on, finishing 
her gate spell with skill and confidence. 

"The gate is open!" she cried.  "Malkizid, come forth !" 
Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic 

coalesced from the air.  Through  it she glimpsed the realm 
of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, 
windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson 
lightning.  Then , through the gate,  the archdevil Malkizid 
appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his 
infernal plane into the myth a/ chamber. 

-Richard Baker, Farthest Reach 

A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to 
other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can 
directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with 
different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows 
adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral 
projection spell lets adventurers project themselves 
into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the 
Outer Planes. 

Plane Shift. The plane shift spell has two important 

limitations. The first is the material component: a 
small, forked , metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to 
the desired planar destination. The spell requires the 
proper resonating frequen cy to home in on the correct 
location , and the fork must be made of the right material 
(sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic 
properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), 
but even the act of researching the correct specifications 
can lead to adventure. After all. not many people 
voluntarily travel into the depth  of Carceri, so very few 
know what kind of tuning fork i  required to get there. 
Second, the spell doesn't  end the caster to a specific 

location unless he or she ha  pecialized information. 
The sigil sequence of a teleponation ci rcle located on 
another plane allows the ca  rer ro travel directly to that 

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING A 

E 

circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come 
by tha n the specifications of the required tuning 
fork.  Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to 
a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. 
Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely 
still need to  undertake a journey to reach the object of a 
planar quest. 

Gate. The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific 
point on another plane of existence. The spell provides 
a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of 
the guardians and trials that would normally fill  such 
a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all 
but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to 
negate any obstacles that wait at the destination. 

The gate spell is powerful , but not infallible. A deity, 

demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a 
portal from opening within its dominion. 

ASTRAL PLANE 
Halisstra  opened her eyes and found herself drifting in 
an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in 
the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently 
through the sky, anchored in  ends so distant she couldn't 
perceive th em, their middle parts revolving angrily like 
pieces of string rolled between a child 's fingertips.  She 
glanced down,  wondering what supported her, and saw 
nothing but more of th e strange pearly sky beneath her fee t 
and all around her. 

She drew in  a sudden breath , surprised by the sight, and 
felt her lungs fill  with something sweeter and perhaps a little 
more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning 
on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An 
electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself 
mesmerized by the simple act of respiration. 

-Richard Baker, Condemna tio 

The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream , 
where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach 
the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same 
above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray 
streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most 
of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors 
occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a 

dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the 
silvery void.  Much more commonplace are color pools(cid:173)
magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, 
spinning coins. 

Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from 

hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live 
on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish 
outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so 
their children can grow to maturity. 

A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply 

thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. 
In combat, though, a creature's walking.speed (in feet) is 
equal to 3 x its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature 
is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will. 

ASTRAL PROJECTION 
Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of 
the astral projection spell involves projecting one's 
consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an 
Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much 
spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this 
allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he 
or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. 
A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on 
the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the 
severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral 
Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body 
on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true 
death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to 
the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than 
eek out a portal or use a more direct spell. 
Only a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the 

most common being a psychic wind (described below). 
The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have 
this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral 
Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the 
.-are portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord. 

C OLOR POOLS 
Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other 
planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling 
colors, ld6 x 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another 
plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the 
desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be 
:dentified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools 
table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance: 
.ocating the correct one takes ld4 x 10 hours of travel.

PSYCHIC WIND 
A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on 
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters 
travelers' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic 
wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas, 
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went 
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this 
powerful force. 

A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of 

the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes 
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the 
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself 
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, 
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal 
in a few rounds. 

The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a 

location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers 
journeying together suffers the same location effect. 
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a 
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the 
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20 
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to 
determine the location and mental effects.

ASTRAL PLANE  ENCOUNTERS 
Planar travelers and refugees from other planes wander 
the expanses of the Astral Plane. The most prominent 
denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an 
outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships, 
slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched 
by the AstraL Their city, Tu'narath, floats through the 
Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that is actua lly the body 
of a dead god. 

Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour 

the Astral Plane for color pools leading to desired 
destinations. Characters who linger for too long 
in the Astral might have an encounter with one or 
more wandering angels, demons, devils, night hags, 
yugoloths, or other planar travelers. 

ETHEREAL PLANE 
Tamlinfelt a hand on him , felt his body shimmer into 
mist The screams and shouts sounded far off- The walls 
around him appeared to be only gray shadows. Rival en 
and Brenn us stood beside him. 

"The ethereal plane," Rivalen said.  "The dragon's breath 

cannot affect us here." 

- PaulS. Kemp, Shadowstorm 

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. 
Its "shores," called the Border Ethereal, overlap the 
Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every 
location on those planes has a corresponding location 
on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal 
is limited to 60 feet The plane's depths comprise a 
region of swirl ing mist and fog called the Deep EthereaL 
where visibility is limited to 30 feet 

Characters can use the etherealness spell to enter 

the Border EthereaL The plane shift spell allows 
transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, 
but unless the intended destination is a specific location 
or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could  be 
anywhere on the plane. 

BORDER ETHEREAL ------

From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into 
whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted 
and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and 
its edges turning fuzzy.  Ethereal denizens watch the 
plane as though peering through distorted and frosted 
glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the 
other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually 
invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with 
the aid of magic. 
- Normally, creatures in  the Border Ethereal can't 
attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice 
versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and 
utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and 
solid objects on the overlapped plane don't ha mper 
the movement of a creature in the Border EthereaL 
The exceptions are certain magical effects (including 
anything made of magical force) and living beings. This 
makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, 
spying on opponents, and moving around without being 
detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws 
of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as 
easily as walking. 

DEEP ETHEREAL -------

To reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a plane shift 
spell or arrive by means of a gate spell  or magical portaL 
Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling 
mist Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of 
vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a 
traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to 
a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild. 
or the ShadowfelL The color of the curtain indicates the 
plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see 
the Ethereal Curtains table.

Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from 
one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance 
is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can 
move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure 
speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip 
between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 
x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In 
combat, however, creatures are considered to move at 
their normal speeds. 

ETHER CYCLONES 
An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins 
through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, 
distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and 
carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 
rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. 
Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading 
elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a d20 and 
consult the Ether Cyclone table to  determine the effect 
on all creatures in the vicinity.

The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to 

extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a 
group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma 
aving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel 
is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel 
time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the 
Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone 
rears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party 
into the Astral Plane. 

E THEREAL PLANE  ENCOUNTERS 
_lost encounters in the Border Ethereal are with 
eatures on the Material Plane whose senses or 

abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders, 
:or example). Ghosts also move freely between the 
:=:rhereal and Material Planes. 

In the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other 
~velers ,  particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such 
...: elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the 
- casional celestial, fiend , or fey. 

FEYWILD 
Stepping into the portal was like settling into a warm bath, 
though the chill didn't jade from the air. At first everything 
muted-the roar of the river around the rocks below, the 
ch irp ing of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of 
th e town behind him . ... A moment later,  the world erupted 
into vibrant life.  Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air 
was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the 
flo wers in  iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing 
of th e river became a complex symphony. 

-James Wyatt, Oath of Vigilance 

The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of 
soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a 
realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights 
bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing 
through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the 
faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly 
sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, 
dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas 
ruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, 
the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and 
syrupy fens- perfect territory for the unseelie fey to  hunt 
their prey. 

The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material 

Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same 
cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild 
mirrors the natural world but turns its features into 
spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the 
Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper(cid:173)
sized crystals that glow with internal fire  towers in the 
Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane 
might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great 
beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of 
sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old 
ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the 
door of an arch fey's castle. 

The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such 
as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as 
centaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs, 
faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker 
regions of the plane are home to such malevolent 
creatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants. 

SEELIE  AND  UNSEELIE  FEY 
Two  queens  hold  court in  the  Feywild,  and  most fey  owe 
allegiance to one or the other.  Queen Titania and  her 
Summer Court lead the seelie fey,  and the Queen of Air and 
Darkness,  ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey. 
Seelie and  unseelie do  not directly correlate with  good  and 
evil,  though  many mortals  make that equation.  Many  seelie 
fey  are good,  and  many unseelie are evil,  but their opposition 
to each other stems from  their queens' jealous rivalry,  not 
abstract moral  concerns.  Ugly  denizens of the Feywild,  such 
as fomorians and  hags, are almost never members of either 
court,  and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely. 
The courts have warred  at times,  but they also compete in 
more-or-less friendly contests and even  ally with  one another 
in  small and secret ways. 

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING  A  MULTIVERSE

FEY CROSSINGS 
Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the 
Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the 
Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. 
A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a 
clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of 
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To 
the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked 
into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler 
is there one moment and gone the next. 

Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings 

open infrequently. A crossing might open only during 
a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for 
someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing 
can be closed permanently if the land on either side is 
dramatically altered- for example, if a castle is built 
over the clearing on the Material Plane. 

OPTIONAL RULES:  FEYWILD  MAGIC 
Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures 
and spirited away to the Feywild, only to  return to their 
parents years later without having aged a day, and 
with no memories of their captors or the realm they 
came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an 
excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover 
upon their return that time flows differently on the 
Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit 
are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the 
strange magic that suffuses the plane. 

MEMORY LOSS 
A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 
10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like 
elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that 
fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its 
time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the 
creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. 
Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's 
lost memories. 

TIME WARP 
While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, 
characters might spend a day there and realize, upon 
leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed 
everywhere else in the multiverse. 

Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves 

the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, 
you can choose a time change that works best for your 
campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp 
table. A wish spell can be used to remove the effect on 
up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability 
to  grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries 
agree to subject themselves to a geas spell and complete 
a quest after the wish spell is cast.

and the feeling made him too big by half. 

-PaulS. Kemp, The Godborn 

he Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a 
dimension of black, gray, and white where most other 
color has been leached from  everything. It is a place of 
darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black 
ault with neither sun nor stars. 
The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much 
r.be same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless 
landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. 
Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable 
on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped(cid:173)
distorted reflections of what exists on the Material 

Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, 
the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged 
rock outcropping with a resemblance to  a skull, a heap 
of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great 
castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, 
its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and 
its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by. 

Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this 
bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the 
gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles. 

SHADOW CROSSINGS 

Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations 
where the veil between the Material Plane and the 
Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one 
plane to  the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a 
dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an 
open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places 
where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as 
battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only 
in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss. 

DOMAINS  OF  DREAD 
In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach 
horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of 
terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of 
Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle 
Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, 
the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the 
Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for 

these "darklords,"  and through cruelty or carelessness 
trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well. 

OPTIONAL RULE: 
SHADOWFELL DESPAIR 
A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. 
Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with 
despair, as reflected in this optional rule. 

When you deem it appropriate, though usually not 
more than once per day, you can require a character 
not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failure , the character is affected by 
despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the 
Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different 
despair effects of your own creation.

Effect 
Apathy. The character has disadvantage on 
death saving throws and on  Dexterity checks for 
initiative, and gains the following flaw:  "I  don't 
believe  I can  make a difference to anyone or 
anything." 
Dread. The character has disadvantage on  all 
saving throws and  gains the following flaw: "I  am 
convinced that this  place is  going to kill  me." 
Madness. The character has disadvantage 
on  ability checks and saving throws that use 
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and gains the 
following flaw:  "I  can't tell  what's  real  anymore." 

If a character is already suffering a despair effect and 

fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces 
the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character 
can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's 
harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) 
On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that 
character. 

A calm emotions spell removes despair, as does any 

spell or other magical effect that removes a curse. 

EVER NIGHT 
The city of Neverwinter in  the world  of the  Forgotten  Realms 
has a dark  reflection  on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. 
Evernight is  a city of cracked  stone edifices and  homes of 
rotten wood.  Its  roads are  made mostly of trampled grave 
dust, and  its few  cobbled streets are  missing enough stones 
that they appear pockmarked. The sky  is  corpse gray, and the 
breeze blows cold  and  humid,  bringing a chill  to the skin. 
The city's living  residents  include mad  necromancers , 

corrupt purveyors of human flesh,  worshipers of evil deities, 
and others who are able to  make themselves useful  and crazy 
enough to want to live  here. But the living are a minority 
in  Evernight,  for the bulk of the population consists of the 
shambling dead. Zombies, wights, vampires , and other 
undead  make the city their home,  all  under the watchful  eyes 
of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eating ghouls. 

Rumors  abound that this foul  place mirrors one city on 

every world.

INNER PLANES 
He was lying on his back upon baked and smoldering stone. 
staring up at a smoky gray sky lit fro m distant and unseen 
fires. Around him , a sea of lava burped gouts of gas and jets 
of flame.  The Elemental Plan e of Fire. 

Thank the fell ones, Vhok thought. I never thought I'd be 

so happy to be here. 

-Thomas M.  Reid, Th e Gossamer Plain 

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material 
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental 
substance from which all worlds were made. The four 
Elemental Planes- Air, Earth, Fire, and Water- form 
a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within 
a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. 
These planes are all connected, and the border regions 
between them are sometimes described as distinct 
planes in their own right. 

At their innermost edges, where they are closest 
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal 
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes 
resemble places in the Material Plane. The four 
elements mingle together as they do in  the Material 
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant 
element exerts a strong influence on the environment, 
reflecting its fundamental qualities. 

The inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra, 

azers, dragon turtles, gargoyles, genies, mephits, 
salamanders, and xorn. Some originated on the 
Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material 
Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and 
survive there. 

As. they extend farther from the Material Plane, 

the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and 
hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements 
exist in their purest form:  great expanses of solid earth, 
blazing fire , crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any 
foreig-n substance is extremely rare; little air can be 
found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, 
and earth is all but impossible to  find  in the outermost 
reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less 
hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than 
the border regions are. Such regions are little known, 
so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a 
speaker usually means the border region. 

The outermost regions are largely the domains of 
elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. 
The creatures usually called elementals dwell here, 
including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial 
beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits 
that spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems, 
invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These 
elemental creatures don't need food or other sustenance 
on their home planes, because they are sustained by the 
elemental energies that saturate those planes. 

ELEMENTAL CHAOS ----

At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure 
elements dissolve a nd bleed together into an unending 

wt of clashing energies and colliding substance 
ed the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found 
-a  well, but they usually don't stay long, preferring 
~ .:omfort of their native planes. Reports indicate 

~xistence of weird hybrid elementals native to the 
ental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen

At the other end of the plane. near the Frostfell (the 

plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region 
of frigid winds called the Mistral Reach. These gales 
drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, 
.toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach 
are covered with snow and ice. 

PLANE  OF  EARTH 

I  Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and 

tradition. The plane's position opposite the Plane of 
Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its 
opposition to almost everything air represents. 

The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising 

higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane. 
It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks 
of its highest mountains. Most visitors to  the plane 
arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the 
mountains. 

The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called 

the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is 
home to  the capital city of the dao, the City of jewels. 
The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams 
of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of 
ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, 
every building and significant object in the city is made 
from precious stones and metals, including the slender 
gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city 
is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao 
population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is 
punishable by death, with punishment extending to  the 
thief's relatives. 

The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on 
the Plane of Fire) are called the Furnaces. Lava seeps 
through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The 
dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to 
process their ores and shape their precious metals. 

The border region between the planes of Water and 
Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees 
and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and 
slime. Here and there within the Swamp of Oblivion 
(also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools 
play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of 
mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden 
structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on 
platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven 
deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud 
of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink 
down into it. 

It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of 

Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now 
and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into 
this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time. 
The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to 
brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in 
search of these treasures. 

The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of 

Oblivion is called the Mud Hills. Landslides constantly 
wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades 
of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The 
Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, 
pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing. 

PLANE  OF  FIRE 
Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At 
its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the 
efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of 
inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame 
of desire. 

A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky 

above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 
1-l-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep 
::-ed at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane 
display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly 
lin ding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) 
takes place during the darker hours. 

The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds 

and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures 

ot native to the plane must cover their mouths and 

eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to 
·eep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, 
- ut elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least 
· lustery and rises to hurricane force during the 

orst storms. 
The heat in the Plane of Fire is compa rable to 
a hot desert on the Material Plane,  and poses a 
::imilar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat"  in 
hapter 5, "Adventure Environments"). The deeper 
one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes. 
3eyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, 
-

travelers must carry their own supplies or produce 
ater by magic. 
The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast Cinder 
astes, a great expanse of black cinders and embers 
ossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders 

bartle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the 
~ reet.  Ancient ruins dot the desert- remnants of 
:"orgotten civilizations. 

A great range of volcanic mountains called the 

Fountains of Creation is home to azers. These rocky 
;>eaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around 
- e Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. 
the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called 
e P la ne of Magma. Fire giants and red dragons 

:nake their homes here, as well as creatures from the 

eighboring planes. 
Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane 
f Air and pools into a great lava sea, called the Sea 

of Fire, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. 
-lands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea, 
otted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful 
::-ed  dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands 
the City of Brass. 

TH E  CITY OF BRASS 
Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is 
the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This 
i  the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and 
metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature. 
True to  the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in 
, 
the city seems alive with dancing flames , reflecting the 
.;brant energy of the place. 

Adventurers frequently come here on quests for 

.egendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at 
all. the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any 

item for sale, though the price might wei! be more than 
gold. The efreet are fond  of trad ing in favors , especially 
when they have the upper hand in  negotiations. Perhap 
a magical disease or poison ca n be cured only with 
something that must be purchased in the bazaars 
of the city. 

The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal 

Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns 
supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of 
slaves, guardians, and sycophants. 

PLANE OF WATER 
The nature of water is to  flow, not like the gusting wind 
or the leaping flame , but smoothly and steadily. It is the 
rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of 
mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given 
time, it can erode all  in its path. 

A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of 

Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water 
at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a day, 
however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge 
of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of 
lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering 
array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky. 

The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the Sea 
of Worlds, dotted here and there with atolls and islands 
that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to 
stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move 
across the sea sometimes create temporary portals 
to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane 
of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds 
and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever 
returning home. 

The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. 
If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare 
oc.casions, a tremor in  the planar firmament sends a 
rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire 
islands and driving ships down to the reefs. 

Life flourishes in  the upper reaches of the Sea of 

Worlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight 
filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft 
castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids 
are the distant stewards of this region, content to  allow 
the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal 
emperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen 
Thousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and 
studded with pearls. 

The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight 

reaches, are called the Darkened Depths. Horrid 
creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing 
pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed 
to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other 
mighty leviathans claim this realm. 

Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is 

hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the 
plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve 
as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most 
natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea 
and thus ignore these habitations. 

One of the few actual islands on the plane is the Isle 

of Dread. The island is connected to the Material Plane 
by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island.

' THE 
EM ENTAL 
PLANES 

~ravelers who know the strange tides and currents 
of the plane can travel between worlds freely,  but the 
5  orms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the 
- a nd's shore. 
The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp 

of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the Silt 
Flats. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns 
.mo muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp 
between the planes. 

At the other extreme of the plane is the Sea oflce, 

bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with 
cebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving 
creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs 
can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of 
'Yater to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas. 

The Frostfell, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the 

border between the planes of Air and Water and is a 
seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging 
bl izzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of 
Ice, home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other 
creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in 
a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure 
their survival. 

Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the 

Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar 
·:oyagers keep to  the air, braving the powerful winds and 
driving snow to  avoid setting foot on the great glacier. 

OUTER PLANES 
Streamers of noxious gas streaked that crimson dome like 
dirty clouds.  They whirled to form  what looked like giant 
eyes staring down , eyes that were swept away before they 
couldfocus, only to form  anew, again and again.  Beneath 
the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and 
flumes of sparks and goutingjlame, where things slithered 
and scrambled half-seen in  the shadows. Mountains clawed 
the ruby sky.  The Land of Teeth , Azuth had once aptly 
called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks.  This was the 
Greeting Ground, the realm of horror that had claimed 
the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above 
Avernus, uppermost of the Nine Hells. 

-Ed Greenwood, Elminster in Hell 

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that 
makes up  the multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the 
direction , thought, and purpose for its construction. 
Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as 
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the 
Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities. 

When discussing anything to do with deities, the 
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their 

CHAPTER 2  J  CREATING A  MULTlVERSE 

57 

actual homes aren't literally places at all, but exemplify 
the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and 
spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine 
the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border 
region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond 
ordinary sensory experience. 

Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be 

deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear 
hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. 
But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful 
forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake 
them completely,  effectively erasing and rebuilding 
existence to  better fulfill their divine needs. 

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the 

Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can 
seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what 
seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided 
tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, 
in a single day- if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it 
could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek 
across a single layer. 

The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes 

that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding 
neutrality, which is represented by the Outlands, 
described in the section on "Other Planes") and the 
shades of distinction between them.

The planes with an element of good in their nature are 
called the Upper Planes, while those with an element 
of evil are the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is 
its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't 
match the plane's alignment experiences a sense of 
dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, 
for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an 
evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little 
uncomfortable. 

The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, 
including angels, couatls , and pegasi. The Lower Pla nes 
are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, 
and their ilk. The planes in between host their own 
unique denizens: the construct race of modrons 

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  MULTT\'ERSE 

inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi 
thrive  in Limbo. 

LAYERS  OF THE  O U TER PLANES 
Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct 
environments or realms. These realms are often 
imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the 
same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For 
example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer 
cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has 
a seemingly endless number of layers. 

Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a 

multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as 
the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the 
arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions 
like a city gate for that plane. 

TRAVELING THE  OUTER PLANES 
Traveling between the Outer Planes isn't dissimilar 
from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. 
Characters traveling by means of the astral projection 
spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and 
there search out a color pool leading to the desired 
destination. Characters can also use plane shift to reach 
a different plane more directly. Most often, though, 
characters use portals- either a portal that links the two 
planes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Door  . 
which holds portals to all the planes. 

Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes 

together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. 
Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign, 
such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower 
Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes. 
or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another 
in your cosmology. 

THE RIVER STYX 
This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and 
the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any 
creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the 
water ·is affected by a feeblemind spell. The DC of the 
Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is  15. 

The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, 

the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and 
Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower 
layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx 
winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing 
passage from one layer of that plane to the next. 

Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed 

by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable 
currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots 
are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. 
Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of 
dead creatures from the Material Plane. 

THE INFINITE  STAIRCASE 
The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral 
staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the 
Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript 
door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an 
equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The 
Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and 

-=:;.·.,.,-,<1·"-. going from simple stairs of wood or stone to a

and chaotic alignments doesn't have the same 
-o Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality. 

MOUNT CELESTIA 
The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises 
from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and 
utterly incomprehensible, with seven plateaus marking 
its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of 
justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, 
where angels and champions of good guard against 
incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the 
planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its 
inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as 
possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest 
and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the 
purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the 
most jaded of travelers with awe. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  BLESSED  BENEFICENCE 
In contrast to  the dissonance experienced by evil 
creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by 
the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of 
good alignment gain the benefit of the bless spell as long 
as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long 
rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a 
lesser restoration spell. 

BYTOPIA 
The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are 
similar yet opposite: one is a tamed , pastoral landscape 
and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect 
the plane's goodness and its acceptance of law and 
order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of 
productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The 
goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of 
goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  PERVASIVE  GOODWILL 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a 
visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good 

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING A  MULTIVERSE 

59 

must make a DC  10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good 
or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's 
current alignment). The change becomes permanent 
if the creature doesn't leave the plane within ld4 days. 
Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal 
after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
also restores its original alignment. 

ELYSIUM 
Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and 
compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers 
seeking a safe haven. The plane's bucolic landscapes 
glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility 
seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the 
plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where 
tears of joy glisten on many a cheek. 

OPTIONAL RuLE :  OvERWHELMING joY 
Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming 
trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment 
and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor must make a DC  10 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to  leave 
the plane before taking another long rest. After three 
failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves 
the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its 
power to  return to the plane. A dispel evil and good spell 
removes this effect from the creature. 

THE  BEASTLANDS 
The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests 
ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden 
pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so 
tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains 

and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The 
plane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also 
speaks to the animal within all living things. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  HUNTER'S  PARADISE 
Visitors to the Beastlands find  their hunting and 
stalking capabilities improved, and characters have 
advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom 
(Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  BEAST TRANSFORMATION 
Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the 
slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw 
or become transformed (as the polymorph spell) into the 
type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature 
retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of 
each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature 
returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. 
the transformation can be undone only by a remove 
curse spell or similar magic. 

ARBOREA 
Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods 
and deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of 
passions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its 
good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to  fighting evil, 
but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with 
devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as 
honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and 
forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and 
every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits 
that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly. 
Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elve 
born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at 
heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they 
look and behave like normal elves.

-eep track of how many days a visitor spends on 
borea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a 
a risma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for 

ach day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the 
:;eature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to 
- ;borea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has 
~dvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long 
~-r. the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending 

e effect on a success. A dispel evil and good spell 

-~moves this effect from the creature. 

GARD 

:gard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep

-e long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold 
unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of 
-
a nic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous

:ainst giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that 
-:..:nder across Ysgard's vast terrain. 

?TI ONAL RULE :  IMMORTAL WRATH

~  ruct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a 

-- ·  while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next

·[ions and afflictions it suffered before its death 

bo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of 
rmanent matter and energy. Stone melts into 
. [hat freezes into metal, then turns into diamond 

that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and 
on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of 
change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes- bits 
of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling 
streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is 
a nightmarish riot. 

Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane 

float in place. A creature can move up to its walking 
speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired 
direction of travel. 

Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting 

it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create 
whole islands of their own invention within the plane, 
sometimes maintaining those places for years. A 
simpleminded creature such as a fish , though, might 
have less than a minute before the pocket of water 
surrounding it freezes , vanishes, or turns to glass. 
The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, 
creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire 
monasteries with their minds. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  POWER OF THE  MIND 
As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an 
Intelligence check to mentally move an object on 
the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC 
depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for 
Small, DC  15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 
for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature 
moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by 
which it beat the DC. 

A creature can also use an action to make an 

Intelligence check to alter a non magical object that isn't 
being worn or carried. The same rules for distance 
apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 
10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and 
DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature 
changes the object into another nonliving form of the 
same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire. 

Finally, a creature can use an action to make an 

Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered 
on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the 
sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; 
each additional 10 feet added to  the radius increases the 
DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents 
the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or 
until the creature uses this ability again. 

PANDEMONIUM 
Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of 
rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is 
cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly 
extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches 
and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only 
by yelling, and even then only to  a maximum distance 
of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability 
check that relies on hearing. 

Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were 
banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many 
of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds 
or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die 
down until they sound like distant cries of torment. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  MAD WINDS 
A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a 
failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. 
A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while 
on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains 
a random form of indefinite madness, as described in 
chapter 8, "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest 
doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the 
creature can somehow escape the maddening winds. 

THE ABYSS 
The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and 
chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into 
ever more appalling forms. 

----------- --

Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific 

environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are 
all  harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the 
en tropic nature of the Abyss. In fact,  much of what one 
sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, 
crumbling, or corroded state. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  ABYSSAL CORRUPTION 
A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss 
must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a 
failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to  the 
Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of 
this corruption. You can substitute different corruption 
effects of your own creation. 

After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can 

make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful 
save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good 
spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends 
the effect. 

If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within 

ld4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
restores its original alignment.

Result 
Treachery. The character gains the following flaw: 
"I  can only achieve my goals  by  making sure that 
my companions don 't achieve theirs." 
Bloodlust. The character gains the following flaw: 
" I enjoy killin g for  its  own  sake,  and once I start, 
it's  hard to stop." 
Mad Ambition. The character gains the following 
flaw:  " I am destined to rule the Abyss, and  my 
companions are tools to that end." 
Demonic Possession. The character is  possessed 
by  a demonic entity until freed  by dispel evil and 
good or simi lar magic. Whenever the possessed 
character rolls  a  1 on an  attack roll,  ability check, 
or saving throw, the demon takes control  of the 
character and determines the character's behavior. 
At the end of each of the possessed character's 
turns,  he or she can make a  DC  15  Charisma saving 
throw.  On a success, the character regains control 
until  he or she rolls  another 1. 

IMPORTANT LAYERS 
The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords 
who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. 
More information about the demon lords can be found in 
the Monster Manual. 

The Gaping Maw. Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss 
is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known 
as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons 
go insane with fear.  Reflecting Demogorgon's dual 
nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval 
continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a 
seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine fiats.  The 
Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine 
towers, which emerge from  a turbid sea. Each tower 
is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires 
constitute the fortress of Abysm , where few creatures 
can venture without descending into madness. 

Thanatos. If Orcus had his way, all planes would 

resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures 
would become undead under his control. Under its 
black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren 
moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. 
Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi 
litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, 
bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any 
creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules 
Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted 
of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland 
called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs 
and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow 
valleys, creating a tiered necropolis. 

The Demonweb. Lolth's layer is an immense network 

of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and 
cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, 
structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught 
in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates 
random portals throughout the plane, drawing such 
objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds 

that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. 
Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, 
trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within 
crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone. 

Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless 

Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, 
Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens- yochlol 
demons created to serve her and which outrank 
mightier demons while in the Spider Queen's realm. 

The Endless Maze. Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is 
a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the 
Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing 
jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the 
palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing 
a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels 
ead ing deeper into the fortress. 

The Triple Realm. The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules 

over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three 
ayers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic 
Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling 
markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across 
me multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and 
perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons 
of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly 
comity.  However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as 

uch danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar 
i  itors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities 
and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches. 

Death DeJJs. Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known 
Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. 

.=:ven the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, 
- are the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate 

eir master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking 

_  ey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for 

lease in the Gnoll Lord's realm. 

CARCERI 
-:-he model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri 
- a pla ne of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold 

r bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged 
ountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All form a 
·  erable home for the traitors and backstabbers that 

- -e trapped on this prison plane. 

O PTIONAL RULE:  PRISON PLA NE 
_ -o one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave 
· e plane by any spell other than a wish simply fail. 
:>onals and gates that open onto the plane become one(cid:173)

y only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are 
- -dden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters. 

:-lADES 

-----------------------------------

- e layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms(cid:173)

aces without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with 
:~ ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls 
- ar are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or 
· e fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls 
- come larvae and spend eternity in this place that 

cks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away 
lor and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors 
can stand. The "Shadowfell Despair" rule earlier in the 

apter can be used to represent a visitor's despair. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  V I LE TR A NSFORMATION 
At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor 
must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which 
can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades. 
If the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn't 
die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into 
a larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the 
creature are removed. 

A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial 

features of its previous form but has the body of a fat 
worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its 
previous life and the statistics in the larva stat block. 

Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and 

rakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other 
fiends like to feed on them.

Hit: 1 (1d4- 1)  piercing damage. 

GEHENNA 
Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the 
birthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great 
numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the 
four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earth bergs 
drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains. 
The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here 

difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least 
45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs 
and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles. 
Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious 
fumes or searing flames. 

Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The 

fiends living here are among the greediest and most 
selfish in all the multiverse. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  CRUEL HINDRANCE 
The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to 
help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a 
beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points 
or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 
10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell 
fails , the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted. 

CHAPTER 2  I CREATTNG  A  MULTI VERSE 

THE  NINE  HELLS 
The Nine Hells of Baa tor inflame the imaginations of 
travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle 
fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of 
law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. 
The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws 
of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual 
castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul , 
to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy 
is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to 
be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. 
Such is the law of the Nine Hells. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  PERVASIVE  EVIL 
Evil  pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane 
feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes 
permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within 
ld4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts 
to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the 
Nine Hells. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the 
creature also restores its original alignment. 

THE NINE LAYERS 
The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are 
each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, 
the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the 
deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend 
through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The 
most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, 
which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer 
to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can 
withstand the torment and horror of that journey. 

Avernus. No planar portals connect directly to  the 
lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus's orders. 
As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point 
for visitors to the plane. A vern us is a rocky wasteland 
with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies.  Fiery 
comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and 
leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields 
are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the 
legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native 
soil and prevailed. 

The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting 
her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus's favor 
and is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the 
Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, 
ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells 
by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract 
(the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the 
Lords of the Nine). 

Zariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel 
festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of 
guests who failed to earn the archduchess's favor.  Zariel 
appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and 
wings have been ruined by fire.  Her eyes burn with a 
furious white light that can cause creatures looking 
upon her to burst into flame . 

Dis. Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a 

labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains 

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING A  MULTIVERSE 

rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through 
the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron 
fortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles. 

The second layer takes its name from its current lord. 

Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is 
devilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail, 
and a cloven left hoof to  distinguish him from a human. 
His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City 
of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the 
Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with 
devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, 
incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a 
piece of every deal through special provisions that are 
added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells. 

Dispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and 

resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse 
can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils 
with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their 
souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil 
schemes in the Material Plane. 

Minauros. The third layer of the Nine Hells is a 

stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's 
brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid 
surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to 
engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately 
carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great 
city of Minauros for which the layer is named. 

The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into 
the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The 
Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent 
with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned 
humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is 
one of the few arch devils who will trade favors for gold 
instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures 
left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him 
in a deal. 

Phlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a 

fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew 
hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic 
ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest 
volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian 
and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring 
down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted 
centerpiece of a gigantic, hellish fountain. 

Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils 

who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and 
Archduchess Fierna , Belial's daughter. Belial is a 
handsome,  powerfully built devil who exudes civility, 
even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His 
daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the 
blackest hear t in  the 
and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their 
mutual survival hinges on it. 

ine Hells. The alliance of Belial 

Stygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing 

realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea 
surrounds the layer. and its gloomy sky crackles with 
lightning. 

Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is 
now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. 
He rules this layer all the same, communicating 
telepathically with hi  followers and servants, both in 
the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane. 

Stygia is also home to its previous  ruler, the 

serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed 
by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus 
to  regain his rule. Geryon's fall  from grace has 
spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No 
one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret 
cause to dismiss the archdevi l or whether he is testing 
Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose. 

Malbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted 

many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess 
and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell  out of favor and 
was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while 
her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on 
the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's 
favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the 
sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the 
layer break off from time to  time, creating deadly and 
deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of 
.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves 
carved into the mountainside. 

Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's 
daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with 
her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She 
inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from 
her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on 
the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars 
and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of 
collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with 
cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and 
torments those who displease her. 

Maladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin(cid:173)
covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban 
landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, 
crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of 
empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies. 
The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, 

the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower 
body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was 
inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for 
wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and 
degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to 
usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries 
a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to 
calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor 
fo r reasons no other archduke can fathom , though some 
suspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the 
worthiness of this fallen adversary. 

Cania. Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is 

an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from 
bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for 
guests and prisoners of Cania's  ruler, the brilliant and 
conniving archdevil Mephistopheles. 

Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, 

where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and 
conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy 
and ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to 
trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered. 
Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until 
his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so 
both wait to see what circumstances might turn them 

against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of 
sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship. 

Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive 

horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, asv o 
other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to  any 
creatures not worthy of his person~! ~ttention .. His 
instincts are as razor sharp as Camas fngtd wmds, 
and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever d~vea or 
thwarted him. 

/ 

Nessus. The lowest layer of the Nine"'Hells, Ness us is 
a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. 
There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison 
their diabolical legions and p)ot the conquest of the 
multiverse. At the center oUhe layer stands a vast 
rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great 
citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his 
infernal court. 

Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out 

stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that 
Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing 
him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep 
price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has 
claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors. 

Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, 

bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from 
his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. 
He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen 
without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is 
the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The 
ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he 
wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage. 

ACHERON 
Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron 
cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes 
collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the 
plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. 
That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the 
spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against 
orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, 
and legions assembled by other warmongering gods. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  BLOODLUST 
Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures 
by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep 
fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary 
hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever 
it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points. 

MECHANUS 
On Meehan us, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork 
gears. all interlocked and turning according to their 
measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation 
so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus 
embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on 
those who spend time here. 

Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. 

The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a 
godlike being called Primus. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  LAW OF AVERAGES 
While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average 
damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an 
attack that normally deals ldlO + 5 damage always 
deals 10 damage on Mechanus. 

OPTIONAL RULE:  IMPOSING  ORDER 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor 
that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment 
changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment 
reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other 
than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell 
on the creature also restores its original alignment. 

ARCADI~A~---------------------­
Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, 
ruler-straight streams, orderly fields,  perfect roads, and 
cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The 
mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on 
Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless 
form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing 
intrudes on harmony. 

Night and day are determined by an orb that floats 

above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates 
sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds 
moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb 
rotates evenly without fail,  spreading day and night 
across the entire plane. 

The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied 

demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the 
Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. 
Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of 
weather that king or queen controls. 

Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are 
numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood 
the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane 

66 

CHAPTER 2  I CREATING  A  MULTTVERSE 

have the celestial type and are always brave and 
kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like 
normal dwarves. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  PLANA R VITALITY 
Vhile on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or 
poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison. 

OTHER PLANES 
A variety of realms exist between or beyond the 
other planes. 

T HE  OUTLANDS AND  SIGIL 
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. 
Ir is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of 
everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical 
balance- simultaneously concordant and in opposition. 
The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, 
and shallow rivers. 

T he Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact , 

£hose whp envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point 

(Q the ovtlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the 
planes. That argument might be circular, since the 
arrange~ent of the Outlands inspired the idea of the 
Great \\\heel in the first place. 

Aroun'd the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, 

are the g~te-towns: sixteen settlements, each built 
around a ~ortalleading to one of the Outer Planes. Each 
rown shares many of the characteristics of the plane 

where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in 
these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, 
such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while 
sharing a fine bottle of wine. 

Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the 

Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed 
campaign can be set there without the need for planar 
travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes 
come to being like a world on the Material Plane.

CHAPTER  2  I CREATING  A  MULTIVERSE 

SIGIL ,  CITY  OF DOORS 
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great 
wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that 
rises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow 
peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad 
structures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures 
standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve 
up over their heads and- most disconcerting of all-the 
far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of 
Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless 
portals to other planes and worlds. 

Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and 
information come here from across the planes. The city 
sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, 
particularly the command words or items required for 
the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all 
kinds are bought and sold here. 

The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, 

a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to 
even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the 
fallen creator of the multiverse? No  one knows. Or if 
they do,  they aren't telling. 

DEMIPLANES 
Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come 
into being by a variety of means and boast their own 
physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist 
naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest 
of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can 
carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency 
required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to 
acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the 
caster knows of the demiplane. 

A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or 
large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, 
a Mordenkainen 's magnificent mansion spell creates a 
demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining 
rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft 
setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the 
sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a 
demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some 
other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping 
through a portal or passing through a wall of mist. 

THE  FAR REALM 
The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In 
fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its 
own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies 
from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter 
is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable 
geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers 
and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its 
strange influence. 

The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are 
too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. 
Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and 
unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who 
dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm 
is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of 
matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this 
struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone

KNOWN WORLDS dF THE 

I 
MATERIAL PLANE 
Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The 
most widely known worlds are the ones that have been 
published as official campaign settings for the D&D 
game over the years. If your campaign takes place on 
one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your 
campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly 
from what's in print. 

On Toril (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten 
Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand 
amid the remains of ancient empires and realms 
long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich 
with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun, 
Tori! includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, 
and Maztica. 

On Oerth (the sword-and-sorcery world of the 

Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and 
Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The 
hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of 
Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and arch magi, rife with 
adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish 
realm in the north, threatening all civilization. 

On Krynn (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance 
setting),. the return of the gods is overshadowed by the 
rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons 
and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of 
Ansalon into war. 

On Athas (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark 
Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a 
human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, 
where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and 
metal is a scarce and precious commodity. 

On Eberron (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron 

setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold 
war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of 
Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked 
houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles 
make travel to the far corners of the world possible. 

On Aebrynis (the heroic-fantasy world of the 

Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines 
carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, 
guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands 
of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations 
born from the blood of an evil god. 

On Mystara (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the 
earliest editions of the D&D game), diverse cultures, 
savage monsters, and warring empires collide. 
The world is further shaped by the meddling of the 
Immortals- former adventurers raised to  nearly 
divine status.

CHAPTER  3:  CREATING A DV ENTURES 

~ REATI  G ADVENTURES  IS ONE O F THE GREATEST 
rewards of being a Dungeon Master.  It's  a 
way to express yourself, designing fantastic 
locations and encounters with monsters, 
traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you 
design an adventure, you call the shots. You 

o things exactly the way you want to. 
Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure 

shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an 
:ssue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic 
ser ies and serialized TV dramas are particularly good 
com parisons, because of the way individual adventures 
are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger 
na rrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a 
campaign is the series as a whole. 

Whether you're creating your own adventures or using 

;JUblished adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter 
~o help you create a fun and memorable experience for 
:.·our players. 

Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of 

exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified 
whole that meets the needs of your players and your 
campaign. But it's more than that. The basic elements 
of good storytelling should guide you throughout this 
;Jrocess, so your players experience the adventure as a 
- ory and not a disjointed series of encounters. 

ELEMENTS  OF A 
GREAT ADVENTURE 
-=-he  best adventures have several things in common. 

_-\_  C REDIBLE  THREAT 
_-\n adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes' 
c.  rention. The threat might be a single villain or 
;:nonster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of 
::::wnsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their 
arure, the antagonists should have goals that the 

:-:eroes can uncover and thwart. 

?.-\M ILlAR TROPES WITH  CLEVER TWISTS 
:-might seem stereotypical to build an adventure 
;;sound dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, 
"Jut these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might 
also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but 
~h at's an idea that remains true to D&D. Familiar 
srory elements are fine,  as long as you and the players 
occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the 
:-nysterious figure who presents adventurers with 
a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in 
d.isguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a 
;Jrojected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome 
dlieves to guard their loot. 

_\  C LEAR Focus oN THE  PRESE N T 
.-ill adventure is about the here and now. A little bit 
of history might be needed to set the story in motion, 
and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of 
:.1e past in the course of the adventure. In general , let 

rhe world's history be evident in the present situation. 
Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, 
an adventure should focus on describing the present 
situation, what the bad guys are up to,  and how the 
adventurers become involved in the story. 

HEROES WHO  MATTER 
An adventure should allow the adventurers' actions and 
decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel 
or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more 
than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel  as if 
they've been railroaded- set onto a course that has only 
one destination, no matter how hard they try to change 
it.  For example, if a major villain shows up before the 
end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the 
possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain. 

SoMETHING FOR ALL PLAYER TYPES 
As outlined in the book's introduction, players come 
to the gaming table with different expectations. An 
adventure needs to account for the different players and 
characters in your group, drawing them into the story as 
effectively as possible. 

As a starting point, think about your adventure in 

terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: 
exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your 
adventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to 
appeal to all types of players. 

An adventure you create for your home campaign 
doesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type(cid:173)
only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you 
don't have any players who like fighting above all else, 
then don't feel you have to  provide a maximum amount 
of combat to keep the adventure moving. 

SURPRISES 
Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your 
players. For example, the exploration of a  ruined castle 
on a hill  might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb 
hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness 
might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only 
on nights of the full moon. Players remember such 
locations. 

Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but 
adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their 
tactics and think creatively. For example, you could 
spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers 
with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a 
villain's estate might be complicated by the unexpected 
arrival of a special guest. 

When preparing for possible combat encounters, 

think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a 
hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or will(cid:173)
o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have 
surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters 
unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, 
deception, and plot twist to  keep players on their toes, 
but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, 
straightforward encounter with an ore guard is just as 
fun for your players. 

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING ADVENTURES 

USEFUL MAPS 
A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed 
maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting 
landmarks and other features are better than vast 
expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have 
branching corridors and similar decision points give 
players the opportunity to choose which direction their 
characters should go. Presenting the characters with 
options allows the players to make choices that keep the 
adventure unpredictable. 

If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is 
a great place to look for adventure maps that have been 
made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of 
real-world buildings and images that can inspire your 
mapmaking. You can also use software to  help put your 
maps together. 

PUBLISHED ADVENTURES 
Published adventures are available for purchase if you 
have neither the time nor the inclination to write an 
adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. 
A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario 
with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need 
to run it. An example of a published adventure appears 
in the D&D Starter Set. 

You can make adjustments to a published adventure 

so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to 
your players. For example, you can replace the villain 
of an adventure with one the players have already 
encountered in your campaign, or add something to 
the background of the adventure so that it involves your 
players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer 
never could have imagined. 

A published adventure can't account for every 
action the characters might take. The nice thing 
about published adventures is that they allow you to 
focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot 
developments in your campaign that the adventure 
can't address. 

Published adventures also provide inspiration. You 

might not use an adventure as written, but it  might spur 
ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose 
that part for your needs. For example, you might use a 
map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your 
choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model 
for a pursuit scene in your campaign. 

ADVENTURE  STRUCTURE 
Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a 
middle, and an end. 

BEGINNING 
An adventure starts with a hook to get the players 
interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest 
of the players and provides a compelling reason for 
their characters to become involved in the adventure. 
Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're 
not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an 
assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon 
shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as 
these can instantly draw players into your story. 

CHAPTER  3  I CREATJNG ADVENTURES 

The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting 

and focused. You want the players to go home looking 
forward to the next session , so give them a clear sense 
of where the story is headed, as well as something to 
look forward to. 

MIDDLE 
The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the 
story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers 
make important choices that have a clear effect on the 
conclusion of the adventure. 

Over the course of the adventure, the characters might 

discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their 
original goal. Their understanding of what's going on 
around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure 
were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps 
the so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a 
scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even 
more power. 

At the same time the adventurers are working to 

thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying 
to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies 
might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential 
adversaries, or confront problems directly,  perhaps by 
trying to kill meddlers. 

Remember that the characters are the heroes of the 

story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching 
as events unfold around them that they can't influence. 

ENDING 
The ending encompasses the climax- the scene or 
encounter in which the tension building throughout the 
adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have 
the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and 
much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which 
hinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should 
never be a forgone conclusion. 

An ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. 

Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved 
in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is 
an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next. 

ADVENTURE TYPES 
An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as 
discussed in the sections that follow. 

LOCATION-BASED ADVENTURES 
Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote 
wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless 
campaigns. Many of the greatest D&D adventures of all 
time are location-based. 

Creating a location-based adventure can be broken 

down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables 
from which you can select the basic elements of your 
adventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how 
the random results inspire you. You  can mix up the 
order of the steps. 

1.  IDENTIFY THE  PARTY'S  GOALS 
The Dungeon Goals table provides common goals 
that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The 

·:,derness Goals table provides similar inspiration for 
- adventure focused on outdoor exploration. The Other 
~s table suggests location-based adventures that 
:~ a· r  fi t neatly into the first two categories.

Chapter 5 offers suggestions for creating and fleshing 
out an adventure location, including tables that can 
help you establish the important elements of a dungeon, 
wilderness area, or urban setting. 

4.  FIND THE  IDEAL INTRODUCTION 
An adventure can begin with a social interaction 
encounter in which the adventurers find  out what they 
must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack, 
or with the adventurers coming across information by 
accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the 
goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the 
Adventure Introduction table inspire you.

just as that plan  is  about to  be completed. 
The villain  and two or three lieutenants perform 
separate rites  in  a large room. The adventurers 
must disrupt all  the rites at the same time. 
An  ally  betrays the adventurers as they're about to 
achieve their goal.  (Use this climax carefully,  and 
don't overuse it.) 
A portal  opens to another plane of existence. 
Creatures on the other side spill  out, forcing the 
adventurers to close the portal  and deal with the 
villain  at the same time. 
Traps , hazards,  or animated objects turn  against 
the adventurers while the main  villain  attacks. 
The dungeon  begins to collapse while the 
adventurers face the main villain, who attempts to 
escape in  the chaos. 
A threat more powerful than the adventurers 
appears, destroys the main villain,  and then turns 
its  attention on the characters. 
The adventurers  must choose whether to  pursue 
the fleeing  main  villain  or save an  N PC  they care 
about or a group of innocents. 
The adventurers  must discover the main  villain's 
secret weakness  before they can  hope to defeat that 
villain . 

6 . PLA N  E NC OUNTER S 
.:..fter you've created the location and the overall story of 
the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters that 
make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, 
most encounters are keyed to specific locations on 
a map. For each room or wilderness area on the 
adventure map, your key describes what's in that area: 
its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays 
out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch 
of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters 
designed to entertain and intrigue your players. 

See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for 

guidance on crafting individual encounters. 

EVENT- BASED ADVENTURES 
In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the 
characters and villains do and what happens as a 
result. The question of where those things happen is of 
secondary importance. 

Building an event-based adventure is more work than 

building a location-based one, but the process can be 
simplified by following a number of straightforward 
steps. Several steps include tables from which you 
can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for 
inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don't 
necessarily have to follow these steps in order. 

1.  START  WITH A  VILLAIN 
Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, 
since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing 
the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the 
previous section to get started, and use the information 
in chapter 4 to  help flesh  out the villain. 

For example, your villain might be an undead creature 

seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An 
interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past 
injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring 
revenge against the descendants of those that harmed 
it.  Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a 
religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge 
against the current members of that order. 

2. DET E RMINE T HE VI L LAIN'S ACTIONS 
Once you have a villain, it's time to determine what 
steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a 
timeline showing what the villain does and when, 
assuming no interference from the adventurers. 

Building on the previous example, you might decide 
that your vampire villain murders several knights. By 
slipping past locked doors in gaseous form , the vampire 
is able to make the deaths appear natural at first,  but 
it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind 
the murders. 

If you need additional inspiration, consider a few 

different options for how the villain's  actions unfold over 
the course of the adventure.

Big Event. The villain's plans come to fruition during 
a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a 
royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed 
time. The villain's activities up to  that point are geared 
toward preparation for this event. 

Crime Spree. The villain commits acts that become 
bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start 
out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before 
moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing 
the horror and the body count each time. 

CHAPTER  3  I CREATTNG ADVEN TURES

ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain's goal is 
to lie low or flee  the scene. 

Serial Crimes. The villain commits crimes one after 
the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather 
than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The 
trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the 
pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are 
a common example of this type of villain, your villain 
could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of 
building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters 
who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain 
kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and 
impersonating one noble after another. 

Step by Step. In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries 

out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. 
A wizard might steal the items needed to create a 
phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap 
the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. 
Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find 
the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another 
while moving ever closer to the real target. 

3.  DETERMINE THE  PARTY'S  GOALS 
You  can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the 
party's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the 
adventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and 
what exactly they must do to foil  those plans.

Goal 
Bring the villain to justice. 
Clear the name of an  innocent N PC. 
Protect or hide an  N PC. 
Protect an  object. 
Discover the nature and  origin of a strange 
phenomenon that might be the villain's doing. 
Find  a wanted  fugitive. 
Overthrow a tyrant. 
Uncover a conspiracy to overthrow a ruler. 
Negotiate peace  between enemy nations or feuding 
families. 
Secure aid  from a ruler or council. 
Help a villain find  redemption. 
Parley with a villain. 
Smuggle weapons to rebel  forces. 
Stop a band  of smugglers. 
Gather intelligence on an  enemy force. 
Win  a tournament. 
Determine the vi llain 's  identity. 
Locate a stolen  item. 
Make sure a wedding goes  off without a hitch. 
Roll  twice , ignoring results of 20. 

For example, you roll a  10 on the table, indicating that 
the party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. 
You  decide to  connect that to the leadership of the order 
targeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's 
leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire 
centuries ago, and the characters can  use the chest as 
bait to trap the villain. 

VAMPIRE  VILLAIN 

Growing Corruption. As time passes, the villain's 

power and influence grow, affecting more victims 
across a larger area. This might take the form  of armies 
conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new 
members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the 
throne might attempt to secure the support of the 
kingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a 
coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a 
town council or bribe officers of the watch. 

One and Done. The villain commits a single crime 

and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an 

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADYENTURES 

-= ·  I DENTIFY IMPORTANT NPCs 
~a ny event-based adventures require a well-detailed 
;-t of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall  neatly into the 
:.  egories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to 
:-:: characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the 
~ .>.-e nturers remain undecided until the adventurers 
-:.ceract with them. (See chapter 4 for more information 
;:J.  creating NPCs.) 
The elements of the adventure you've determined 

:  J  fa r should provide a clear idea of what supporting 
:~.a racters you need to create, as well as how much 
::::  ail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely 
J  become involved in combat don't need full combat 
:::atistics, for example, just as characters heavily 
::';olved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and 
.:aws. If it's helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or 
-.  venture Patrons tables (in the "Location-Based 
~-

,·entures" section, earlier in this chapter). 

- .  ANTICIPATE THE VILLAIN'S  REACTIONS 
'-.s the adventurers pursue their goals and foil  the 
:.:lain's plans, how does the villain respond? Does it 
a-h out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it 
ClOk for simple solutions to its problems or create more 
:omplicated schemes to route around interference? 
Look over the villain's actions that you outlined in 

:;·ep 2.  For each event arising from those actions, think 
about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they 
:an prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect 
::oes that have on the villain's overall plan? What can 
·ae villain do to compensate? 

One way to  track a villain's reactions is by using a 
:':owchart. This might grow out of the timeline that 
;:!escribes the villain's plans, outlining how the villain 
gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. 
Or the flowchart could be separate from  the timeline, 
·hawing the various actions the adventurers might take 
and the villain's response to those actions. 

6. DETAIL KEY LOCATIONS 
~ ince locations aren't the focus of the adventure, they 
an be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex 
or an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific 
. ocations in a city,  or even individual rooms in locations 
·,yhere combat is likely to break out or significant 
exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild 
~ eadquarters,  a vampire's crumbling manor, or a 
~ ights' chapter house. 

7.  CHOOSE AN INTRODUCTION AND  A  CLIMAX 
The Adventure Introduction table in the "Location(cid:173)
Based Adventures" section offers fun possibilities 
:or hooking the characters into the events of your 
adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple 
plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same 
- ection includes adventure endings that work just as 
well  for event-based adventures. 

For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps 

you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs 
their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes 
that a vampire is trying to kill him , or a friend or relative 

hoping to find  the knight's murderer. This NPC brings 
the vampire's crimes to the characters' attention. 

Looking over the Adventure Climax table, you might 
decide to have the adventurers bait the vampire with a 
chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, 
you decide that the vampire's true goal is to retrieve a 
necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with 
nine gems, and with these gems the vampire can open 
a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire succeed, 
the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal 
with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and 
honors some ancient pact it made with the vampire. 

8.  PLAN  ENCOUNTERS 
After you've created the overall story of the adventure, 
it's  time to plan out the encounters on which the 
events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based 
adventure, encounters occur when the villain's agenda 
intersects the path of the characters. You can't always 
anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but 
you can create a list of possible encounters that the 
adventurers might experience. This can take the form of 
general descriptions of the villain's forces, details of its 
lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to 
the key locations of the adventure. 

S ee "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for 

guidance on crafting individual encounters. 

MYSTERIES 

A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that 
usually focuses on the adventurers' efforts to solve a 
crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of 
a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can't always predict 
what the characters will do in a mystery adventure. 

A villain whose actions are "crime spree," "one and 

done," or "serial crimes" might inspire you to craft 
a mystery adventure around that villain's crimes. 
Similarly, if the adventurers' goals include determining 
the villain's identity, that might be part of a  mystery. 
To build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for 
creating any event-based adventure. Then consider 
three additional elements for the adventure: the victim, 
the suspects, and the clues . 

VICTIM 
Think about the victim's relationship to  the villain. 
Though you can create a strong scenario with no such 
relationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is 
the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs 
and how those connections led to  the crime. A random 
killing might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that 
emotional connection. 

Also look for a connection between the victim and one 

or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw 
adventurers into a mystery- including making them 
suspects- is to make the victim someone with whom the 
characters are acquainted. 

SUSPECTS 
Your cast of characters should include an assortment 
of other NPCs who didn't commit the crime,  but who 
had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. 

CHAPTER  3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES 

77 

Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during 
the investigation. One technique often used in detective 
fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite 
number of individuals whose circumstances make them 
the only possible suspects. 

One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers 

guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that 
more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned 
by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or 
attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A 
secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an 
uncontrolled vice are fl aws that make suspects more 
interesting than NPCs with nothing to  hide. 

CLUES 
Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are 
verbal, including the statements of the sus pects and 
witnesses that help the adventurers  develop a picture 
of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an 
unfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece 
of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found 
hidden in a suspect's  room . 

A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically 

by shedding light on the suspect's motive, means , or 
opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect 
to  the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong 
direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing 
in a different direction, or come across evidence th at 
absolves the suspect. 

It's better to  populate your adventure with too many 

clues than too few.  If the adventurers solve the mystery 
too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but 
the players will feel  a sense of accomplishment. If the 
mystery is too hard, though, the players will become 
frustrated . Since you have to account for the possibility 
that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use 
redundant clues to ensure that the players have the 
knowledge needed to catch the villain. 

INTRIGUE ----

Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that 
revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common 
in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can 
play out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime 
syndicates, and temple hierarchies . 

Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an 

intrigue adventure typically revolves around the 
exchange of favors , the rise and fall of individuals 
in power and influence, a nd the honeyed words of 
diplomacy. A prince's efforts to be named heir to  the 
throne,  a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right 
hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route 
through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue. 

Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only 

if the players and their characters are invested in the 
outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is 
or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing 
the characters into an adventure centered on those 
issues will fall fiat.  However, if having the ear of the 
king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal 
soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the 
borderlands, players will be invested in the scenario. 

CHAPTER 3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES 

Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue 
when they need a favor from a powerful  creature and 
have to  perform  a favor in exchange, or when the plots 
of powerful NP Cs get in the way of the characters 
achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals 
discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to 
intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers 
must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or 
secure aid from  a ruler or council, you might be looking 
at an intrigue adventure. 

The process of creating an intrigue adventure is 

similar to creating a ny other event-based adventure, 
with two main differences: how villains are handled and 
how the characters can gain influence. 

VILLAINS 
Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a 
single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination 
of a monarch. Howeve r, an intrigue adventure can have 
multiple villains or no villain at all. 

No Villain. Some intrigue adventures revolve around 

the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For 
this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event(cid:173)
based adventure creation process (the villain and the 
villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers' 
goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become 
involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time 
creating the NPCs they interact with. 

Many Villains. Some intrigue adventures feature 

a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, 
motivations, and methods. The adventurers  might be 
drawn into the struggle of a court full  of nobles vying 
for the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death, 
or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly 
turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll 
spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2,  developing each of 
the major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda. 

In step 5, you'll  need to develop each villain's reactions 
to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure. 
However, you don't need to put equal effort into deta iling 
the reactions of every villain, since many will likely 
echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever 
the adventurers foil  one villain's plans, it might let 
another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the 
adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not. 

INFLUENCE 
Depending on the scenario, you might want to track 
the party's influence with different NPCs or factions , or 
even track influence separately for each character. 

One way to handle influence is to treat it like 

inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain 
situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence 
into play requires spending it.  Characters can gain 
influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the 
cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power 
and heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, 
a character can choose to spend influence to gain 
advantage on a roll relevant to that influence. 

Another way to handle influence is to treat it like 
renown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain 
renown at court and within various key factions.

COMPLICATIONS 
Sometimes an adventure isn't as straightforward as it 
might seem. 

MORAL QUANDARIES 
If you want to give the characters a crisis that no amount 
of spellcasting or swordplay can resolve, add a moral 
quandary to  the adventure. A moral quandary is a 
problem of conscience for which the adventurers must 
make a single choice-but never a simple one.

on the characters. A love interest might demand that 
a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A 
dear fri end might plead with the characters to spare 
the villain's life, to prove that they are better than the 
villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor 
from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but 
essential mission. 

Honor Quandary. A character is forced to  choose 

between victory and a personal oath or code of honor. 
A paladin who has sworn the Oath of Virtue might 
realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit 
and subterfuge. A Joyal cleric might be tempted to 
disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present 
this quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a 
character to atone for violating his or her oath. 

Rescue Quandary. The adventurers must choose 
between catching or hurting the villain and saving 
innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might 
learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also 
learn that another part of the villain's forces is about 
to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The 
characters must choose between taking out the villain 
or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be 
friends or family members. 

Respect Quandary. Two important allies give 

conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers. 
Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to 
negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby 
forest , while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their 
strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers 
can't follow both courses, and whichever ally they 
choose, the other loses respect for them and might no 
longer aid them. 

TWISTS 
A twist can complicate a story and make it harder for 
the characters to complete their goals.

killing them. 
The adventurers  have a time limit. 
The adventurers have received false or extraneous 
information. 
Completing an  adventure goal  fulfills  a prophecy or 
prevents the fulfillment of a prophecy. 
The adventurers have two different goals,  but they 
can complete only one. 
Completing the goal  secretly  helps the villain. 
The adventurers  must cooperate with  a known 
enemy to  achieve the goal. 
The adventurers are  under magica l compulsion 
(such as a geas spell) to complete the ir goal. 

Ally Quandary. The adventurers have a better chance 

of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals 
whose expertise is all but essential. However, these 
two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together 
even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The 
adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to 
help them accomplish their goal. 

Friend Quandary. An NPC that one or more of the 
characters cares about makes an impossible demand

CREATING ENCOUNTERS 
:::ncounters are the individual scenes in the larger story 
of your adventure. 

First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for 
~he players. Second, it shouldn't be burden for you to 
:un.  Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has 
a straightforward objective as well as some connection 
to the overarching story of your campaign, building on 
the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing 
encounters yet to come. 

An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: 

!he characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, 
or the characters faiL  The encounter needs to account 
for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to 
have consequences so that the players feel  like their 
successes and failures matter. 

CHARACTER OBJECTIVES 
When players don't know what they're supposed to  do 
in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can 
quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent 
objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest. 
For example, if the overall story of your adventure 

involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote 
monastery, each encounter along the way is an 
opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves 
the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might 
see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined 
to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly 
threatening the monastery. 

Some players create their own objectives, which is to 
be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the 
players' campaign as yours. For example, a character 
might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them , 
or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. 
Players who ignore objectives will have to deal w ith 
the consequences, which is another important facet of 
encounter design. 

:  -~-.• ~?=-~ OE ~~ c-:- ::T =: s 
~ ~e io  owing objectiYes can be u  ed as fou ndations 
for encounter  . Although these objectives focus on a 
single encounter during an adventure, using the same 
objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine 
those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the 
adventurers must overcome. 

Make Peace. The characters must convince two 

opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict 
that embroils them. As a complication, the characters 
might have enemies on one or both of the opposing 
sides, or some other group or individual might be 
instigating the conflict to further its own ends. 

Protect an NPC or Object. The characters must act 
as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. 
As a complication, the NPC under the party's protection 
might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too 
young or too old to fight,  or apt to risk the lives of the 
adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the 
adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, 
cursed, or difficult to transport. 

Retrieve an Object. The adventurers must gain 

possession of a specific object in the area of the 
encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a 
complication, enemies might desire the object as much 
as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it. 
Run a Gauntlet. The adventurers must pass through 
a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving 
an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority 
than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a 
complication, as does a decision point that might lead 
characters astray. Other complications include traps, 
hazards, and monsters. 

Sneak In. The adventurers need to move through the 

encounter area without making their enemies aware 
of their presence. Complications might ensue if they 
are detected. 

Stop a Ritual. The plots of evil cult leaders, 

malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve 
rituals that must be foiled . Characters engaged in 
stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through 
evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's 
powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might 
be close to completion when the characters arrive, 
imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its 
completion might have immediate consequences as welL 

Take Out a Single Target. The villain is surrounded 

by minions powerful enough to  kill the adventurers. 
The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain 
another day, or they can try to fight their way through 
the minions to take out their target. As a complication, 
the minions might be innocent creatures under the 
villain's controL Killing the villain means breaking that 
control, but the adventurers must endure the minions' 
attacks until they do. 

CREATING A  COMBAT ENCOUNTER 
When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination 
run wild and build something your players will enjoy. 
Once you have the details figured out, use this section to 
adjust the difficulty of the encounter. 

CHAPTER 3  I CREATING ADVENTURES 

8T 

COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
There are four categories of encounter difficulty. 

Easy. An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters' 

resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose 
a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed. 

Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or 

two scary moments for the players, but the characters 
should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or 
more of them might need to use healing resources. 

Hard. A hard encounter could go  badly for the 

adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out 
of the fight,  and there's a slim chance that one or more 
characters might die. 

Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or 

more player characters. Survival often requires good 
tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

CHALLENGE  RATING 
When  putting together an encounter or adventure, especially 
at lower levels,  exercise caution when  using monsters whose 
challenge rating is  higher than the party's average level.  Such 
a creature might deal  enough damage with  a single action to 
take out adventurers of a  lower level.  For example, an ogre 
has a challenge rating of 2,  but it can  kill  a  l st-level wizard 
with  a single blow. 

In  addition, some monsters have features that might be 

difficult or impossible for  lower-level  characters to overcome. 
For example,  a  rakshasa  has a challenge  rating of 13  and  is 
immune to spells of 6th  level  and  lower.  Spellcasters of 12th 
level  or lower have no  spells higher than 6th level,  mean ing 
that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with  their 
magic,  putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. 
Such an  encounter would  be significantly tougher for the 
party than the monster's challenge rating might suggest. 

CHAPTER  3  I C REATI NG ADVENTURES 

EVALUATING  ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any 
combat encounter. 

1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the 
experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in 
the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table 
below has four XP thresholds for each character level, 
one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a 
character's level to determine his or her XP thresholds. 
Repeat this process for every character in the party. 

2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. For each 
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' 
XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP 
threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each 
category of encounter difficulty. 

For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level 

characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's 
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows: 

Easy:  275  XP  (75 + 75 + 75  + 50) 
Medium:  550 XP  (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00) 
Hard: 825 XP  (225 + 225 + 225 + 150) 
Deadly:  l ,400 XP  (400 + 400 + 400 + 200) 

Record the totals, because you can use them for every 
encounter in your adventure. 

3. Total the Monsters' XP. Add up the XP for all of 

the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP 
value in its stat block. 

4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the 

encounter includes more than one monster, apply 
a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more 
monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making 
against the characters in a given round, and the more 
dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge 
an encounter's  difficulty, multiply the total XP of all 
the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the 
Encounter Multipliers table. 

For example, if an encounter includes four monsters 

worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP 
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. 
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth 
in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to 
help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty. 

When making this calculation, don't count any 

monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below 
the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the 
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly 
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.

5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters' adjusted XP 
value to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold 
that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters 
determines the encounter's  difficulty. 

?or example, an encounter with one bugbear and 
-:~ee hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, 
-:ili ng it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level 
-:aracters and one 2nd-level character (which has 
_ .::.ard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly 
- ounter threshold of 1,400 XP). 

? . .:,.RTY SIZE 
- .::e  preceding guidelines assume that you have a party 
:::~ si sting of three to five  adventurers. 
:; the party contains fewer than three characters, 
-;:;:>ly  the next highest multiplier on the Encounter 
~:.Jt ipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 
_ 5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a 
-uJtiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters. 
J  the party contains six or more characters, use the 
-::xt lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 
_ 5 fo r a single monster . 

For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as 
a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its 
difficulty. 

A party can't benefit from a short rest between parts 
of a multipart encounter, so they won't be able to spend 
Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that 
require a short rest to  regain. As a rule, if the adjusted 
XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is 
higher than one-third of the party's expected XP total 
for the adventuring day (see "The Adventuring Day," 
below), the encounter is going to  be tougher than the 
sum of its parts. 

BUILDING ENCOUNTERS  ON A  BUDGET 
You can build an encounter if you know its desired 
difficulty. The party's XP thresholds give you an XP 
budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy!.

_,, 

x§J.~ 

medium , hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember 
that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than 
their base XP  values would indicate (see step 4). 

For example, using the party from step 2, you can 
build a medium encounter by making sure that the 
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP 
(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and 
no more than 825 XP  (the party's threshold for a hard 
encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such 
as a  manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's 
one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each 
one will count for  1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of 
dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP 
value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the 
party as well. 

To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a 

list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by 
challenge rating. 

THE ADVENTURING DAY 
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average 
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six 
to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the 
adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers 
can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, 
they can handle fewer. 

In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an 

encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and 
other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how 
far the party is likely to progress. 

For each character in the party, use the Adventuring 

Day XP table to  estimate how much XP that character is 
expected to  earn in a day. Add together the values of all 
party members to get a total for the party's adventuring 
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP 
value for encounters the party can handle before the 
characters will need to take a long rest.

SHORT RESTS 
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the 
party will likely need to take two short rests, about one(cid:173)
third and two-thirds of the way through the day. 

MODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
An encounter can be made easier or harder based on 
the choice of location and the situation. 

:ncrease the difficulty of the encounter by one step 
":-am easy to medium, for example) if the characters 
-2.·;e a drawback that their enemies don't. Reduce the 
_ - culty by one step if the characters have a benefit that 
-eir enemies don't. Any additional benefit or drawback 
: .:-hes the encounter one step in the appropriate 
:  :-ection. If the characters have both a benefit and a 
::-awback, the two cancel each other out. 

- ituational drawbacks include the following: 

~he whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn't. 
~he enemy has cover, and the party doesn't. 
~he characters are unable to see the enemy. 
-he characters are taking damage every round from 
some environmental effect or magical source, and the 
enemy isn't. 
The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst 
of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor,  or oth(cid:173)
erwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility 
or makes them sitting ducks. 

ituational benefits are similar to drawbacks except 

'-ar they benefit the characters instead of the enemy. 

.:uN COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 
:-3e following features can add more fun and suspense 

a combat encounter: 

Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the 
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope 
bridge and pools of green slime 
Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, 
uch as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, 
and balconies 
Features that either inspire or force characters and 
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, 
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps 
Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive 
positions, so that characters who normally attack at 
ra nge are forced to move around the battlefield 
Different types of monsters working together 

RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS 
.~s characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon 
omplex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected. 
i<.andom encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. 
:hey are usually presented in the form of a table. When 
a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult 
<he table to determine what the party encounters. 

Some players and DMs view random encounters in an 

adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random 
encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes: 

Create urgency. Adventurers don't tend to  dawdle 
if the threat of random encounters is hanging over 
their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters 
creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to 
rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often 
accomplish this even without an actual encounter.) 
Establish atmosphere. The appearance of 
thematically linked creatures as random encounters 
helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere 
for an adventure. For example, an encounter table 

filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies 
creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to 
prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures 
of the night. 
Drain character resources. Random encounters can 
drain the party's hit points and spell slots, leaving the 
adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. 
This creates tension, as players are forced to make 
decisions based on the fact that their characters aren't 
at full  strength. 
Provide assistance. Some random encounters can 
benefit  the characters instead of hindering or harming 
them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the 
adventurers with useful information or assistance 
when they need it most. 
Add interest. Random encounters can reveal details 
about your world. They can foreshadow danger or 
provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare 
for the encounters to come. 

•  Reinforce campaign themes. Random encounters 

can remind the players of the major themes of the 
campaign. For example, if your campaign features an 
ongoing war between two nations, you might design 
random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present 
nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables 
might include bedraggled troops returning from bat(cid:173)
tle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded 
caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on 
horseback riding for the front lines. While charac(cid:173)
ters are in hostile territory, the tables might include 
battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of 
evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gib(cid:173)
bets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee 
the conflict. 

Random encounters should never be tiresome to you 
or your players. You  don't want the players to feel as if 
they aren't making progress because another random 
encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they 
try to move forward. Likewise, you don't want to spend 
time distracted by random encounters that add nothing 
to  the adventure narrative or that interfere with the 
overall pace you're trying to set. 

Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You 

might find that they distract from your game or are 
otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If 
random encounters don't work for you, don't use them. 

TRIGGERING RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS 
Because you want random encounters to  build on the 
intended narrative of a game session, not compete with 
it, you should choose the placement of those encounters 
carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of 
the following circumstances: 

The players are getting off track and slowing 
down the game. 
The characters stop for a short or long rest. 

•  The characters are undertaking a long, 

uneventful journey. 
The characters draw attention to themselves when 
they should be keeping a low profile. 

CHAPTER 3  I CREATING  ADVENTURES 

CRE ATI NG  R AN DO M  E N COUNTER TABLES 
Creating your own random encounter tables is 
straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters 
might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the 
likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then 
arrange the results. An "encounter" in this case could be 
a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, 
a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), 
or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a 
message scrawled on a wall). 

Assemble Your Encounters. Once you've established 

a location through which the adventurers are likely to 
pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make 
a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. 
If you're not sure which creatures to include, appendix B 
has lists of monsters organized by terrain type. 

For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table 

that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, 
dryads , satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant 
owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest , the table 
might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps 
gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and 
hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. 
Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, 
such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs. 
The table could also use a few random encounters of 
a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned 
trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered 
elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn 
creatures invisible when ingested. 

When choosing monsters for a random encounter 

table, try to imagine why the monsters would be 
encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster 
up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for 
something? Also consider whether a creature is moving 
stealthily as it travels through the area. 

As with planned encounters, random encounters 

are more interesting when they happen in memorable 
locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing 
a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or 
be pushing through a dense section of forest when 
they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, 
characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or 
a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches. 

Probabilities. A random encounter table can be 

created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll 
ld6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated 
(roll percentile dice , modify for time of day,  and cross(cid:173)
index the modified number with the dungeon level). The 
sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 
2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 
+ 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters 
appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to 
occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end 
of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a  1 percent 
chance of either), while each of the rolls  from 9 to 13 
occurs a little over 8 percent of the time. 

The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example 

of a random encounter table that implements the ideas 
mentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat 
blocks that appear in the Monster Manual. 

\ 

CHECKING FOR RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS 
You decide when a random encounter happens, or you 
roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once 
every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the 
day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the 
most sense based on how active the area is. 

If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or 

higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an 
appropriate random encounter table to determine what 
the adventurers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn't 
make sense given the circumstances. 

Random encounter tables might be provided as part 

of the adventure you're running, or you can use the 
information in this chapter to build your own. Creating 
your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes 
and flavor of your home campaign. 

Not every run-in with a nother creature counts as 
a random encounter. Encounter tables don't usually 
include rabbits hopping through the und ergrowth, 
harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or 
average citizens walking through the streets of a city. 
Random encounter tables present obstacles and events 
that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or 
themes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions.

RANDOM  ENCOUNTER  CHALLENGE 
Random encounters need not be level-appropriate 
challenges for the adventurers, but it's considered bad 
form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, 
since most players consider this ending to be an 
unsatisfying one. 

Not all random encounters with monsters need 
to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of 
adventurers could have a random encounter with a 
young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search 
of a quick meal, but the characters should have the 
option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon 
spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone 
giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention 
of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the 
party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might 
attack only characters who annoy it. 

That said, a random encounter table usually includes 

hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that 
are meant to be fought. The following monsters are 
considered appropriate combat challenges: 

•  A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or 

lower than the party's level. 
A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value consti(cid:173)
tutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party, 
as determined using the encounter-building guide(cid:173)
lines earlier in this chapter.

CHAPTER 4:  CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS 

NONPLAYER CHARACTER IS A NY CHARACTER 
controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can 
be enemies or allies, regular folk or named 
monsters. They include the local innkeeper, 
the old wizard who lives in the tower on the 
outskirts of town, the death knight out to 

destroy the kingdom, and the dragon counting gold in its 
cavernous lair. 

This chapter shows you how to flesh out non player 

characters for your game. For guidelines on generating 
monster-like stat blocks for an NPC, see chapter 9, 
-Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
DESIGNING NPCs 
_ ·othing brings your adventures and campaigns to life 
better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, 
_ ' PCs in your game rarely need as much complexity 
a  a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most 
_ ' PCs are bit players in the campaign, whereas the 
adventurers are the stars. 
QuicK NPCs 
An  NPC doesn't need combat statistics unless it poses 
a rhreat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two 
qualities to  make them memorable. For example, 
:our players will have no trouble remembering the 
no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose 
on his right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the 
broken nose. 
DETAILED  NPCs 
For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures, 
allow more time to flesh out their histories and 
personalities. As you'll see, ten sentences can sum up 
he main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence 
·or each of the following: 

Occupation and history 
Appearance 
Abilities 
Talent 
Mannerism 
Interactions with others 
Useful knowledge 
Ideal 
Bond 
Flaw or secret 

Although the material here focuses on humanoid 

_·pes, you can adjust details to create monstrous 
_ ' PCs as well. 

OCCU PATION AND  HISTORY 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's occupation 
and provide a brief historical note that hints at the 
cha racter's past. For example, the NPC might have 
-erved in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or 
adventured years ago. 

APPEARANCE 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's most distinctive 
physical features. You  can roll on the NPC Appearance 
table or choose a feature that suits the character.

The NPC might know something as banal as the 
best inn in town or as important as a clue needed to 
solve a murder.

In a sentence, describe one ideal that the NPC holds 
dear and which governs his or her greater actions. 
Player characters who uncover an NPC's ideal can 
use what they've learned to influence the NPC in a 
social interaction (as discussed in chapter 8, "Running 
the Game'} 

Ideals can connect to alignment, as shown on the 

NPC Ideals table. The alignment connections here are 
suggestions only; an evil character could have beauty as 
an ideal, for instance.

element of the character's personality or history that 
could potentially undermine the character-or a secret 
that the NPC is trying to hide. 

The NPC Flaws and Secrets table provides several 

ideas. The backgrounds in the Player's Handbook 
can be used to create more detailed flaws.  Player 
characters who uncover an NPC's flaw or secret can use 
what they've learned to influence the NPC in a social 
interaction (as discussed in chapter 8).

MoNsTERS  As  NPCs 
_ amed monsters that play a significant role in an 
adventure deserve the same attention you would give to 
a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, 
bonds, flaws , and secrets. If a beholder mastermind 
is behind the criminal activities in a city, don't rely 
olely on the entry in the Monster Manual to describe 
the creature's appearance and personality. Take the 

time to  give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of 
appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. 

As an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder 
that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of 
Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in 
leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its 
eyes talks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some 
of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's 
speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its 
central eye away from creatures it speaks to.  Like all 
beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though 
it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. 
The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to 
access virtually any location within or under the city. 

The Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful 

magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, 
and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate 
cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers 
ofWaterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors 
and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for 
exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods , scented oils, and 
rare spices and herbs. 

Establishing this information allows you to play the 

Xanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The 
complexities of the creature's characterization create 
more memorable interaction and interesting story 
possibilities. 
NPC  STATISTICS 
When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three 
main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it 
needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the 
NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a 
bit of explanation. 

/ 

USING A  MONSTER S-TAT  BLOCK 
Appendix B of the l}f-<:fnster Manual contains statistics 
for many gen~;pe-i"fPCs that you can customize as you 
ee-fit;"affi!Chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on 
adjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block. 

USING  CLASSES AND  LEVELS 
You  can create an NPC just as you would a player 
character, using the rules in the Player's Handbook. 
You  can even use a character sheet to keep track of the 
NPC's vital information. 

Class Options. In addition to the class options in the 

Player's Handbook, two additional class options are 
available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Dea ._ 
domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins. 
Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter. 

Equipment. Most NPCs don't need an exhaustive lis 

of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat 
requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the 
NPC carries (including magic items that might be used 
against the adventurers). 

Challenge Rating. An NPC built for combat needs a 
challenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to  determin 
the NPC's challenge rating, just as you would for a 
monster you designed. 

NPC PARTY MEMBERS 
NPCs might join the adventuring party because they 
want a share of the loot and are willing to  accept 
an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the 
adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, 
or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you 
can transfer control to the players. Even if a player 
controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure the NPC i 
portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not jus· 
as a servant that the players can manipulate for their 
own benefit. 

Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as 
a party member and earns a full share of experience 
points. When determining the difficulty of a combat 
encounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC 
party members. 

Low- LEVEL FoLLOWERS 
Your campaign might allow player characters to take on 
lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin 
might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard 
might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a 
cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as 
an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as 
an understudy. 

One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to 
join the party is that players have backup characters if 
their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One 
disadvantage is that you and your players have more 
party members to account for. 

Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal 

party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly 
than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such 
experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to 
them. It also means the adventurers' advancement is 
slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an 
NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden. 
Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge 
for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to 
instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower.  The 
adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources 

An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer 

loyal to  the party and might part ways with them. A 
loyalty score can never drop below 0. 

An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life 

and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC 's 
loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. 
An NPC whose loyalty drops to  0 no longer acts in the 
party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the 
party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or 
works in secret to bring about the party's downfall. 

CONTACTS 
Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of 
the player characters. They don't go on adventures, 
but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or 
professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some 
of the backgrounds in the Player's Handbook suggest 

protecting lower-level NPC party members and to 
provide healing when this protection fails. 
A DVENTURER NPCs 
If you don't have enough players to form a full  party, 
;·ou can use NPCs to fill  out the ranks. These NPCs 
-hould be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer 
in the party and built (either by you or your players) 
using the character creation and advancement rules in 
the Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the 
players create and run these supporting characters. 

Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters 

a  true to  the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds, 
and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across 
automatons. If you don't feel  that an NPC is being 
portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give 
i  to another player, or simply have the NPC leave 
~e party. 

J  PC supporting characters are easier to play if you 

imit their class options. Good candidates for supporting 
characters include a cleric with the Life domain , a 
-ghter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the 
- hief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation. 

O PTIONAL RULE:  LOYALTY 
_oyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine 
· ow far an NPC party member will go to protect or 
--sist the other members of the party (even those 
she doesn't particularly like). An  NPC party 
·ho is abused or ignored is likely to abandon 
- e party, whereas an NPC who owes a life 
haracters or shares their goals might fight to  the death 
:or them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by 
this rule. 

:..oYALTY ScoRE 
_.\n  PC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 

to 20.  The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal 

-o the highest Charisma score among all adventurers 
the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that 
umber. If the highest Charisma score changes(cid:173)
;x:rhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the 
-PC's loyalty score accordingly. 

TRA CKING LOYALTY 
'eep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that 
- e players won't know for sure whether an NPC party 
~ember is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently 
:mder a player's control). 

An NPC's loyalty score increases by  ld4 if other party 
embers help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. 

:... - ·ewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if 
-·  e  PC is treated particularly well (for example, given 
a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party 
member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised 
above its maximum. 

When other party members act in a manner that 

;-uns counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce 
-he  PC's loyalty score by  ld4. Reduce the NPC's 
nyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, 
r endangered by other party members for purely 
:  !fish reasons. 

CHAPTER  4  C REATING  NONPLAYER  CHARACTERS 

93 

contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are 
likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of 
their adventuring careers. 

A name and a few choice details are all you need 
for casual contacts, but take the time to fl esh out a 
recurring contact, especially one who might become an 
ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some 
thought to a contact's goals and how those goals are 
likely to  come into play. 

PATRONS 
A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, 
providing help or rewards as well as quests and 
adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested 
interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't need to 
be persuaded to help them. 

A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks 

younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor 
who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon 
demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by 
offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local 
countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned 
estate cleared of monsters. 

HIRELINGS 
Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services 
in a variety of circumstances. Information on 
hirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment,"  of the 
Player's Handbook. 

Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an 

adventure, and most require little development. When 
adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town 
or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger 
is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even 
converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A 
ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is 
also a hireling, but such a character has the potential 
to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the 
adventure unfolds. 

When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term 

work, add the cost of that NPC's services to the 
characters' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional 
Expenses" section of chapter 6, "Between Adventures ," 
for more information. 

ExTRAS 
Extras are the characters and creatures in the 
background that the main characters rarely, if ever, 
interact with. 

Extras might be elevated to more important roles by 
virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a 
player might be hooked by a passing reference you make 
to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation 
with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you 
placed no importance becomes a central figure in an 
improvised roleplaying scene. 

Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up 
with names and mannerisms on the fly.  In a pinch, you 
can plunder the race-specific character names found  in 
chapter 2, "Races," of the Player's Handbook.

VILLAINOUS 
CLASS  OPTIONS 
You can use the rules in the Player's Handbook to create 
NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create 
player characters. The class options below let you create 
two specific villainous archetypes: the evil  high priest 
and the evil knight or anti paladin. 

The Death Domain is an additional domain choice for 

evil clerics, and the Oathbreaker offers an alternative 
path for paladins who fall from grace. A player can 
choose one of these options with the your approval. 

CLERIC :  DEATH  DOMAIN 
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that 
cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives 
rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, 
Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers, 
death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. 
Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubi  . 
Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease 
or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the 
underworld (Hades and He!). 

DEATH  DOMAIN  SPELLS 

Cleric  Level 

l st

Spells 
fal se  life,  ray of  sickness

animate dead, vampiric touch 
blight,  death  ward 
anti life shell, cloud kill 

BONUS  PROFICIENCY 
When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or 
she gains proficiency with martial weapons. 

REAPER 
At  1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip 
of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric 
casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only 
one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures 
within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

VILLAIN 's  SECRET WEAKNESS 
Finding and exploiting a villain's weakness can be 
very gratifying for players, although a smart villain 
tries to conceal its weakness. A lich, for example, has 
a phylactery- a magical receptacle for its soul- that it

C HANNEL DIVINITY 
An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the 
:ollowing two Channel Divinity options. 

Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one 
ndead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him 

or her.  The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's 
commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin 

uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead 
w hose challenge rating is equ al to or greater than the 
paladin's level is immune to  this effect. 

Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels 
the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of 
m agical menace. Each creature of the paladin's choice 
within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom 
s aving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, 
the target is frightened of the paladin for  1 minute. If a 
creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 
30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another 
Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it. 

AURA  OF  HATE 
Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and 
undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus 
to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin's 
Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can 
benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. 
f\t 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 

SUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE 
At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons. 

DREAD  LORD 
At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround 
himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 
minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a  30-foot 
radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an 
enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn 
in the aura, it takes 4dl0 psychic damage. Additionally, 
the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura 
are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on 
sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures 
draped in this shadow. 

While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus 

action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the 
aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a 
melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, 
the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +.the 
paladin's Charisma modifier. 

After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again 

until he or she finishes a long rest. 

0ATHBREAKER  ATONEMENT 
If you allow a player to choose the Oath breaker option , 
you  can  later allow the paladin to atone and  become a true 
paladin once more. 

The paladin who wishes to  atone  must first  shed his or 

her evil  alignment and demonstrate this  alignment change 
through words and  deeds . Having done so, the paladin 
loses all  Oath breaker features  and  must choose a deity 
and a sacred oath.  (With  your permission , the player can 
select a different deity or sacred oath than the character 
had  previously.) However, the paladin doesn 't gain the 
class featu res specific to  that sacred oath  until  he or 
she completes some kind  of dangerous quest or trial , as 
determined  by the  DM . 

A paladin who  breaks his  or her sacred  oath a second time 

can  become an  oath breaker once  more, but can 't atone.

C HAPTER 5: ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

ANY D&D ADVENTURES REVOLVE 
around a dungeon setting. Dungeons 
in D&D include great halls and tombs, 
subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths 
riddled with death traps, natural 

caverns extending for miles beneath the 

-urface of the world, and ruined castles. 

.  ot every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A 
:ilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a 
arrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread 

can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the 
great outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search 
f prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim 
·ortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres 
plunder farmsteads for food , and monstrous spiders 

op from the web-shrouded canopies of trees. 
Within a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by 
:ails and doors around them , but in the wilderness, 
adventurers can travel in almost any direction they 
please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon 
and wilderness: it's much easier to predict where the 
adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the 
ptions are limited- less so in the wilderness. 

illages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization 
n a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities 
·  r adventure. Encounters with monsters ·might seem 
Jlllikely within a city's walls, but urban settings have 
·  eir own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many 
·orms, and urban settings aren't always the safe havens 
.hey seem to be. 

Th is chapter provides an overview of these three 

environments plus a few unusual environments, taking 
:-ou through the process of creating an adventure 
ocation, with plenty of random tables to inspire you. 

DUNGEONS 
- me dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the 
•  lk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird 
..airs carved out by foul monsters. They attract evil cults, 

onster tribes, and reclusive creatures. Dungeons are 
o home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic 

-ems, and other valuables hidden away in the darkness, 
ften guarded by traps or jealously kept by the monsters 
·  at have collected them. 

B uiLDING  A  DuNGEO N

Except in the case of a natural cavern, a dungeon

Death Trap. This dungeon is built to eliminate any 

creature that dares to enter it. A death trap might guard 
the treasure of an insane wizard, or it might be designed 
o lure adventurers to their demise for some nefarious 
pu rpose, such as to feed souls to a lich's phylactery. 
Lair. A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical 
airs include ruins and caves. 

Maze. A maze is intended to deceive oi- confuse 

those who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles 
that protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for 
prisoners banished there to  be hunted and devoured by 
the monsters within. 

Mine. An abandoned mine can quickly become 

infested with monsters, while miners who delve too 
deep can break through into the Underdark. 

Planar Gate. Dungeons built around planar portals 

are often  transformed by the planar energy seeping out 
th rough those portals. 

Stronghold. A stronghold dungeon provides a secure 

base of operations for villains and monsters. It is 

ually ruled by a powerful individual, such as a wizard, 

·:ampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex 
ilian a simple lair. 

Temple or Shrine. This dungeon is consecrated to 
a deity or other planar entity. The entity's worshipers 
control  the dungeon and conduct their rites there. 

Tomb. Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as 

well  as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead. 

Treasure Vault.  Built to protect powerful magic items 
and great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are 
: eavily guarded by monsters and traps. 

HI STORY 
n most cases, the original architects of a dungeon are 
ong gone, and the question of what happened to them 
can help shape the dungeon's current state. 

The Dungeon History table notes key events that 
can transform a site from its original purpose into a 
dungeon for adventurers to  explore.  Particularly old 
dungeons can have a history that consists of multiple 
events, each of which transformed the site in some way.

DUNGEON  INHABITANTS 
After a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything 
might move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon 
scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn 
to  dungeons. 

The monsters in a dungeon are more than a 

collection of random creatures that happen to live 
near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and 
predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside 
intelligent creatures who share living space through 
elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and 
bloodshed. 

Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, 

ally with one faction, or play factions against each other 
to  reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. 
For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind !layers 
and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try 
to incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt 
against their illithid masters. 

DUN GE ON FACTIONS 
A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group 
of intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs 
that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of 
trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, 
particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of 
creatures share space and compete for resources. 

For example, orcs that dwell  in the mines of a ruined 

dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the 
hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind 
!layers that have established a colony in the lowest 
levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key 
hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all 
the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and 
plots to slay the mind !layers, then enslave whatever 
creatures a re left. 

It's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of 

encounters , with the adventurers kicking down door 

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVTRONMENTS 

101 

after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the 
ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon 
provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle 
interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking 
unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that 
canny monsters seek to exploit. 

Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether 

as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious 
as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in 
founding an empire. Such creatures might approach 
adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to  prevent 
the characters from laying waste to their lair and to 
secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders 
of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing 
out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use 
those elements to shape a response to the arrival of 
adventurers in their territory. 

DUNGEON ECOLOGY 
An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The 
creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and 
sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators 
need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures 
search for lairs offering the best combination of air, 
food , water, and security. Keep these factors in mind 
when designing a dungeon you want the players to 
believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic 
to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable 
decisions within that environment. 

For example, characters who find  a pool of fresh water 

in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that 
many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to 
that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush 
at the pool. Likewise, locked doors- or even doors that 
require hands to open-can restrict the movement of 
some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, 
the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or 
stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive. 

ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
You might be inclined to increase the encounter 
difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the 
dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as 
the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. 
However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a 
grind. A better approach is to include encountets of 
varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy 
and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex 
encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics 
and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar. 

MAPPING A  DUNGEON 
Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. 
The dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history, 
and inhabitants should give you a starting point for 
designing your dungeon map. If you need further 
inspiration, you can find maps that have been made 
freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a 
map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can 
borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly 
generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented 
in appendix A. 

A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers 

in a ruined temple to  a huge complex of rooms and 
passages ex tending hundreds of feet in all directions. 
The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon 
entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve 
deeper underground or push farther into the heart of 
the complex. 

A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, 

with each s quare on the paper representing an area of 
10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, 
you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 
feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot 
grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you 
draw your map, keep the following points in mind: 

Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a 
dungeon less predictable. 
Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, 
ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation 
make a dungeon more interesting and make combat 
encounters in those areas more challenging. 

•  Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you 

want to stress that the dungeon's builders were 
extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be 
commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections 
of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes 
might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting 
rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles. 
Incorporate natural features into even a constructed 
dungeon. An  underground stream might run through 
the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation 
in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating 
features such as bridges and drains. 

•  Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the 

players a stronger sense of making real decisions than 
having multiple ways to  enter a dungeon. 
Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players 
who take .the time to search for them. 
If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, 

see appendix A. 

DUNGEON  FEATURES 
The atmosphere and physical characteristics of 
dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt 
might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor 
of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring 
with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone 
walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically 
reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by 
jets of flame in every hall and room. 

WALLS 
Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have 
walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a 
rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of 
water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made 
of wood or composite materials. 

Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, 

bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or 
torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built 
into them. 

102 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVlRONMENTS 

CATACOMBS 

• 

D OORS 

Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches 
and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of 
gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that 
reveal clues as to what lies beyond. 

Stuck Doors. Dungeon doors often become stuck 

when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires 
a successful Strength check. Chapter 8,  "Running the 
Game," provides guidelines for setting the DC. 

Locked Doors. Characters who don't have the key 
ro a locked door can pick the lock with a successful 
Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves' tools and 
proficiency in their use).  They can also force the door 
with a successful Strength check, smash the door to 
pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock 
spell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines 

for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and 
other objects. 

Barred Doors. A barred door is similar to a locked 
door, except that there's no lock to pick, and the door 
can be opened normally from the barred side by using 
an action to  lift the bar from its braces. 

SECRET DOORS 

A secret door is crafted to  blend into the wall that 
surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff 
marks on the floor betray the secret door's presence. 

Detecting a Secret Door. Use the characters' 

passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to determine 
whether anyone in the party notices a secret door 
without actively searching for it.  Characters can also 
find  a secret door by actively searching the location 
where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom 

CHAPTER  5  j  ADVENTURE  ENVfRONMENTS 

(Perception) check. To set an appropriate DC for the 
check, see chapter 8. 

Opening a Secret Door. Once a secret door is 

detected, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check 
might be required to  determine how to open it if the 
opening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according 
to the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8. 

If adventurers can't determine how to open a secret 

door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it 
as a locked door made of the same material as the 
surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to 
determine appropriate DCs or statistics. 

CoNCEALED DooRs 
A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from 
view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its 
surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most 
often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered 
by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of 
a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, 
no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A 
character need only look in the right place or take the 
right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use 
the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to 

determin·e whether any of them notices tracks or signs 
of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed. 

PORTCULLISES 
A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or 
iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It 
blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into 
the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a 
portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing 
guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged 
attacks or cast spells through it. 

Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. 

If a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is 
on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis 
or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through 
them requires a successful Strength check. The DC 
of the check depends on the size and weight of the 
portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an 
appropriate DC, see chapter 8. 

DARKNESS AND  LIGHT 
Darkness is the default cond ition inside an underground 
complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an 
inhabited dungeon might have light sources. 

104 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVTRONMENTS 

In subterranean settlements, even races that have 

darkvision use fire  for warmth, cooking, and defense. 
But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. 
Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into 

usty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned 
;uins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and 
natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt. 

The light of a torch or lantern helps a character 
:  e over a short distance, but other creatures can 
:  e that light source from far away. Bright light in an 
environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, 
j]ough a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare 
underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources 
JJ a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon 
•eatures that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi 
-o the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers' 
anention. 

_U R QUALITY 

ubterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often 
enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it's rare for 
a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have 
ouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and 

oppressive. What's more, odors linger in a dungeon and 
can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere. 

O UNDS 

A dungeon's enclosed geography helps channel sound. 
The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down 
hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder ·noises such 
a  the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle 
can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many 
creatures that live underground use such sounds as a 
"';'\ay of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an 
adventuring party's intrusion. 

DUNGE ON  HAZARDS 
The hazards described here are but a few examples of 
the environmental dangers found underground and in 
other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally 
imilar to traps, which are described at the end of 
th is chapter. 

Detecting a Hazard. No ability check is required 

to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that 
resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime 
or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful 
Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in 
chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made 
to s pot or recognize a hazard. 

Hazard Severity. To determine a hazard's deadliness 

relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap 
and compare the damage it deals with the party's level 
using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the 
chapter (the table also appears in chapter 8). 

BROWN  MOLD 
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from 
anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically 
covers a  10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 
feet of it is always frigid. 

When a creature moves to withi n 5 feet of the mold 

for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it 
must make a DC  12 Constitution saving throw, taking 
22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 

Brown mold is immune to fire,  and any source of fire 

brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly 
expand outward in the direction of the fire,  covering a 
10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the 
center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to 
an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed. 

GREEN  SLIME 
This acidic slime devours flesh , organic material, and 
metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings 
to walls, floors , and ceilings in patches. 

A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has 
blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from 
walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. 
Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware 
of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with 
a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, 
the slime can't be avoided as it drops. 

A creature that comes into contact with green slime 

takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the 
damage again at the start of each of its turns until the 
slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or 
metal, green slime deals 11  (2d10) acid damage each 
round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or 
tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed. 
Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect 
that deals cold, fire,  or radiant damage destroys a patch 
of green slime. 

WEBS 
Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages 
and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled 
areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering 
a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its 
turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving 
throw or become restrained by the webs. A restrained 
creature can use its action to try to escape, doing 
so with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 

Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC  10,  15 
hit points, vulnerability to fire,  and immunity to 
bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. 

YELLOW MOLD 
Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers 
a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of 
spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the 
mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or take 11  (2d10) poison 
damage and become poisoned for  1 minute. While 
poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison 
damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. 

Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly 

destroys one patch of yellow mold.

WILDERNESS 
Between the dungeons and settlements of your 
campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain 
ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting 
to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be 
a fun part of your game, both for you and your players. 
The following two approaches work particularly well. 

TRAVEL- MONTAGE APPROACH 
Sometimes the destination is more important than the 
journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get 
the characters to where the real adventure happens, 
gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for 
encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel 
montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a 
matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of 
descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in 
your players' minds before moving on. 

Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep 

the forward momentum. "You walk for several miles 
and encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less 
evocative and memorable than, "A light rain dampens 
the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, 
you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue 
finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face , but 
otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary." 
The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the 
desired mood rather than describe everything down to 
the last blade of grass. 

Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, 
a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over 
the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the 
forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also 
describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of 
a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the 
sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest. 

In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help 
set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches 
on the Internet can lead you to  breathtaking landscapes 
(in fact , that's a good phrase to search for)  both real and 
fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, 
wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that 
their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, 
spice up your descriptions with some truly magical 
element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets 
instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with 
giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these 
elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can 
break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A 
single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic 
and memorable landscape is enough. 

Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your 

adventure. In one forest , close-set trees shroud all 
light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. 
In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above 
and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs 
of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and 
rocks covered with slimy brown moss- can be a signal 
that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil 
power that is their destination or can provide clues to 
the nature of the threats to  be found there. 

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

S pecific wilderness locations might have their own 

special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and 
the Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds 
of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different 
weather. a nd different random encounter tables. 

Fina lly,  a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling 

attention to the weather. "You spend the next three 
days crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than, 
"You  spend the next three days trudging through knee(cid:173)
deep mud- the first two days and nights in the pouring 
rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with 
swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood." 

HouR-BY- HouR APPROACH 
Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and 
attention as the destination. If wilderness travel feature 
prominently in your adventure and isn't something you 
want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive 
overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to  life; 
you'll need to know the party's marching order and have 
encounters at the ready. 

Let your players determine the party's marching 

order (see the Player's Handbook for  more information). 
Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to 
notice landmarks and terrain features , as well as the 
ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back 
rank are usually responsible for making sure that the 
party isn't being followed. Encourage characters in the 
middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge 
along behind the front-rank characters. The Player's 
Handbook suggests activities such as mapmaking and 
foraging for food. 

Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of 
planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead 
of time) and random encounters (encounters determined 
by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a 
m~p of the location where the encounter is set to occur, 
such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other 
memorable location. Random encounters tend to be 
less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters 
you have, the more you'll  need to rely on random 
encounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter 
3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter 
tables and when to check for random encounters. 
A good way to keep wilderness encounters from 

becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and 
end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness 
is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, 
think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, 
and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to 
keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes 
at the adventurers from the front , the next one might 
come at them from above or behind. If an encounter 
features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the 
party's pack animals might get the first indication that 
monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If 
an encounter features loud monsters, the party might 
have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of 
monsters might attack the party on sight, and another 
might allow safe passage for food. 

Reward characters for searching while they travel by 

providing things for them to  find.  Broken statues, tracks, 

ro6 r 

abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to 
your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or 
provide hooks for further adventures. 

A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to 

play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes 
long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage 
approach to bridge gaps between encounters. 

MAPPING A  WILDERNESS 
In contrast to a dungeon , an outdoor setting presents 
seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move 
in any direction over a trackless desert or an open 
grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the 
possible locations and events that might make up a 
wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter 
in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis 
because they wander off course? How do you avoid 
creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging 
across a rocky wasteland? 

One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in  the 
same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most 
wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads 
seldom run straight because they follow the contours 
of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest 
routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges 
channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges 
present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote 
passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored 
routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have 
discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to 
traverse than shifting sand. 

If the party veers off track, you might be able to 
relocate one or more of your planned encounters 
elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent 
preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste. 

Chapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a 

wilderness map at three different scales to help 
you design your world and the starting area of your 
campaign. Especially when you get down to province 
scale (1  hex= 1 mile), think about paths of travel- roads, 
passes, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide 
character movement across your map. 

MOVEMENT ON THE  MAP 
Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate 
to the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour 
movement on a province-scale map (1  hex= 1 mile), 
you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. 
At this scale, you can assume that the characters find 
a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unl~ ss 
the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not 
walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when 
they enter a hex, but they can find  old paths, outlying 
ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area. 
If you're tracking a journey of several days on a 

kingdom-scale map (1  hex= 6 miles), don't bother with 
details too small to appear on your map. It's enough 
for the players to  know that on the third day of their 
journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising 
before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two 
days later. 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

WILDERNESS  FEATURES 

o wilderness map is complete without a few 

settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy 
of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an 
a rea roughly 50 miles across is a good start. 

Mo  STER LAIRS 
A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can 
support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably 
no more than one apex predator such as a dragon. 

If you expect the characters to explore a monster's 

lair, you'll  need to find  or create an appropriate map for 
the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon. 

MONUMENTS 
In places where civilization rules or once ruled , 
adventurers might find  monuments built to honor great 
leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table 
for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what 
monument the adventurers stumble upon.

RUINS 
Crumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities 
are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the 
existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a 
road, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble 
of standing stones can add texture to your wilderness. 

SETTLEMENTS 
Settlements exist in places where food , water, farmland , 
and building materials are abundant. A civilized 
province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a 
few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading 
posts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading 
post that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no 
larger settlements. 

In addition to settlements, a province might contain 
ruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or 
serve as lairs for marauding bandits and monsters. 

STRONGHOLDS 
Strongholds provide the local population with protection 
in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an 
area depends on the dominant society, the population, 
the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region, 
and the wealth of the land. 

WEIRD  LOCALES 
Weird locales make the fantastic and the supernatural 
an intrinsic part of your wilderness adventures.

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

EXTREME  COLD 
Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to  the cold must succeed 
on a DC  10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each 
hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with 
resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing 
cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and 
creatures naturally adapted to cold climates. 

EXTREME  HEAT 
When the temperature is at or above  100 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and 
without access to drinkable water must succeed on 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour 
or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the 
first hour and increases by  1 for each additional hour. 
Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are 
clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving 
throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire 
damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as 
do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates. 

STRONG WIND 
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon 
attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames , 
disperses fog,  and makes flying by nonmagical means 
nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind 
must land at the end of its turn or fall. 

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that 
imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight. 

HEAVY PRECIPITATION 
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy 
snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area 
have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that 
rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames 
and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on hearing. 

HIGH ALTITUDE 
--------------~------------------
Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above 
sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, 
because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the 
air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at 
high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of 
determining how long that creature can travel. 

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high 

altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. 
Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to 
elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to 
such environments. 

WILDERNESS  HAZARDS 
This section describes a few examples of hazards that 
adventurers might encounter in the wilderness. 

Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, 

require no ability check to spot. Others, such as 
defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses. 

The other hazards presented here can be identified 
with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the 
guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any 
check made to spot or recognize a hazard. 

DESE CRATED  GROUND 
Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the 
unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated 
ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell 
cast within range reveals its presence. 

Undead standing on desecrated ground have 

adva ntage on all saving throws. 

A vial of holy water purifies a  10-foot-square area of 
desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow 
spell  purifies desecrated ground within its area. 

FRIGID WATER 
A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a 
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before 
suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent 
in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a 
DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of 
exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to 
cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
as do creatures that are naturally adapted to  living in 
ice-cold water. 

QUICKSAND 
A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a  10-foot(cid:173)
square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature 
enters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand 
and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the 
creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as 
the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, 
it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a 
Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet 
the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature 
that is completely submerged in  quicksand can't breathe 
(see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook). 

A creature can pull another creature within its reach 

out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding 
on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of 
feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand. 

RAZORVINE 
Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and 
hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and 
other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 
5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC  11, 25 
hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
psychic damage. 

When a creature comes into direct contact with 
razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature 
must succeed on a DC  10 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's 
bladelike thorns. 

SLIPPERY IcE 
Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves 
onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must 
succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or 
fall  prone. 

no 

CHAPTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVJRONMENTS 

THIN leE 
Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 x 10 pounds per 
10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an 
area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area 
breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall  through. 

FORAGING 
Characters can gather food  and water as the party 
travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character 
makes a Wisdom (Survival) check whenever you call for 
it,  with the DC determined by the abundance of food and 
water in the region.

If multiple characters forage, each character makes

character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much 
fo od (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll 
fo r water (in gallons). 

FooD AND WATER 
The food and water requirements noted in the Player's 
Handbook are for characters. Horses and other 
creatures require different quantities of food and water 
per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if 
the weather is hot.

BECOMING LOST 
Unless they are following a path, or something like it, 
adventurers traveling in the wilderness run the risk of 
becoming lost. The party's navigator makes a Wisdom 
(Survival) check when you decide it's appropriate, 
against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as 
shown on the Wilderness Navigation table. If the party 
is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus 
to the check, a nd a fast pace imposes a - 5 penalty. If the 
party has an accurate map of the region or can see the 
sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.

If the Wisdom (Survival) check succeeds, the party 
travels in the desired direction without becoming lost. 
If the check fails, the party inadvertently travels in the

trying to get back on course.

SETTLEMENTS 
A village, town, or city makes an excellent backdrop for 
an adventure. The adventurers might be called on to 
track down a criminal who's gone into hiding, solve a 
murder, take out a gang of wererats or doppelgangers, 
or protect a settlement under siege. 

When creating a settlement for your campaign, focus 
on the locations that are most relevant to the adventure. 
Don't worry about naming every street and identifying 
the inhabitants of every building; that way lies madness.

RANDOM  BUILDINGS 
Pulse-pounding chases and harrowing escapes within 
the confines of a town or city can sometimes force 
characters to dash into buildings. When you need to 
flesh out a building quickly, roll on the Building Type 
table. Then roll on the table corresponding to that 
building to add further detail. 

If a roll makes no sense considering where the 

characters are (such as a lavish mansion in a rundown 
part of town), you can always roll again or simply choose 
another result. However, such unexpected results can 
prompt creativity and memorable locations that help 
make your urban encounters distinct.

MAPPING A  SETTLEMENT 
When you draw a map for a settlement in your game, 
don't worry about the placement of every building, and 
concentrate instead on the major features. 

For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade 

routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect 
outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of 
the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places 
in the village, mark those spots on your map. 

For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways 

as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls 
and mark the locations of features you know will be 
important: the lord's keep, significant temples, and 
the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about 
the personality of each ward. Give the wards names 
reflecting their personalities, which also identify 
the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood 
(Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical 
characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site 
(the Lords' Quarter). 

URBAN ENCOUNTERS 
Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and 
towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. 
Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, 
shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated 
tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn 
into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must 
learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted 
attention from  local authorities. 

· 

That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble 
can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement 
has to offer. 

LAW AND  ORDER 
Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its 
size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city 
watch to  maintain order and a trained militia to  defend 
its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers 
or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off 
attackers. 

TRIALS 
In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates 
or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the 
conflicting parties or their advocates presenting 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

precedent and evidence until the judge makes 
a decision. with or without the aid of spells or 
interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal 
or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused 
is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a 
trial and skip right to the sentencing. 

SE NTENC ES 
A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals 
awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to 
incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty 
of a crime is usually fined , condemned to forced labor 
for a period of several months or years, exiled, or 
executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime. 

RANDOM  URBAN  ENCOUNTERS 
The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for 
city- and town-based adventures. Check for a random 
encounter at least once per day, and once at night if 
the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it 
doesn't make sense given the time of day.

Animals on the Loose. The characters see one or 

more unexpected animals loose in the street. This 
challenge could be anything from a pack of baboons to 
an escaped circus bear, tiger, or elephant. 

Announcement. A herald, town crier, mad person, 

or other individual makes an announcement on a 
street corner for all to hear. The announcement might 
foreshadow some upcoming event (such as a public 
execution), communicate important information to the 
general masses (such as a new royal decree), or convey a 
dire omen or warning. 

Brawl. A brawl erupts near the adventurers. It could 

be a tavern brawl; a battle between rival factions, 
families, or gangs in the city; or a struggle between 
city guards and criminals. The characters could be 

~~

witnesses, hit by stray arrow fire,  or mistaken for 
members of one group and attacked by the other. 
Bullies. The characters witness ld4 + 2 bullies 

harassing an out-of-towner (use the commoner statistics 
in the Monster Manual for all of them). A bully flees as 
soon as he or she takes any amount of damage. 

Companion. One or more characters are approached 

by a local who takes a friendly interest in the party's 
activities. As a twist, the would-be companion might be 
a spy sent to gather information on the adventurers. 

Contest. The adventurers are drawn into an 

impromptu contest-anything from an intellectual test 
to a drinking competition-or witness a duel. 

Corpse. The adventurers find  a humanoid corpse. 
Draft. The characters are drafted by a member of the 
city or town watch, who needs their help to deal with an 
immediate problem. As a twist, the member of the watch 
might be a disguised criminal trying to lure the party 
into an ambush (use the thug statistics in the Monster 
Manual for the criminal and his or her cohorts). 

Drunk. A tipsy drunk staggers toward a random party 

member, mistaking him or her for someone else. 

Fire. A fire breaks out, and the characters have a 
chance to help put out the flames before it spreads. 

Found Trinket. The characters find  a random trinket. 
You  can determine the trinket by rolling on the Trinkets 
table in the Player's Handbook. 

Guard Harassment. The adventurers are cornered 

by ld4 + 1 guards eager to throw their weight around. If 
threatened, the guards call out for help and might attract 
the attention of other guards or citizens nearby. 

Pickpocket. A thief (use the spy statistics in the 

Monster Manual) tries to steal from a random character. 
Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores 
are equal to or greater than the thief's Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check total catch the theft in progress. 

Procession. The adventurers encounter a group of 

citizens either parading in celebration or forming a 
funeral procession. 

Protest. The adventurers see a group of citizens 

peacefully protesting a new law or decree. A handful of 
guards maintain order. 

Runaway Cart. A team of horses pulling a wagon 
races through the city streets. The adventurers must 
avoid the horses. If they stop the wagon, the owner (who 
is running behind the cart) is grateful. 

Shady Transaction. The characters witness a shady 

transaction between two cloaked figures. 

Spectacle. The characters witness a form of public 

entertainment, such as a talented bard's impersonation 
of a royal personage, a street circus, a puppet show, 
a flashy magic act, a royal visit, or a public execution. 
Urchin. A street urchin gloms onto the adventurers 

and follows them around until frightened off. 

UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS 
Traveling through the wilderness doesn't always mean 
an overland trek. Adventurers might ply the open sea in 
a caravel or an elemental-powered galleon, soar through 
the air on hippogriffs or a carpet of flying, or ride giant 
sea horses to coral palaces deep beneath the sea. 

U  DERWATER 
S ee chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook for rules on 
underwater combat. 

RA NDOM  UN DERSEA ENCOUNTERS 
You can check for random undersea encounters as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3). The 
Random Undersea Encounters table presents several 
intriguing options. You  can either roll on the table for a 
random result or choose whichever one works best.

it contains something of value;  roll  treasure

SwiMMING 
Unless aided by magic, a character can't swim for a 
full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming, a 
character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or gain one level of exhaustion. 

A creature that has a swimming speed-including a 

character with a ring of swimming or similar magic(cid:173)
can swim all day without penalty and uses the normal 
forced march rules in the Player's Handbook. 

Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling 

at high altitudes, because of the water's pressure and 
cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming 
speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater 
than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of 

u6 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

determining exhaustion. Swimming for an hour at a 
depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours. 

N DERWATER VISIBILITY 

\'isibility underwater depends on water clarity and the 
available light. Unless the characters have light sources, 
use the Underwater Encounter Distance table to 
determine the distance at which characters underwater 
become aware of a possible encounter.

Creature Size 
Clear water,  bright light 
Clea r water,  dim light

THE  SEA 
Characters can row a boat for 8 hours per day, or can 
row longer at the risk of exhaustion (as per the rules for 
a forced march in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A 
fully crewed sailing vessel can sail all day, assuming its 
sailors work in shifts. 

NAVIGATION 
Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can, 
because navigation is easier when landmarks are 
visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there 
is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise, a 
ship's navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking 

0 

0 

the direction and distance of the ship's travel) or the sun 
and the stars. 

Use the Wilderness Navigation table earlier in this 
chapter to determine whether a ship veers off course. 

RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS AT SEA 
You can check for random encounters at sea as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3 for 
more information). The Random Encounters at Sea 
table presents a number of options and ideas. 

SHIPWRECKS 
A shipwreck is  a plot device that can  be  used  sparingly to 
great effect,  particularly if you  want the characters to  be 
washed  ashore on  some  monster-infested island or (in the 
case  of an  airship)  dropped in  the middle of some exotic 
land. There aren't rules for determining when  a shipwreck 
happens;  it happens when you  want or need  it to happen. 

Even  the strongest seafaring ship can  founder in  a storm, 
run  aground  on  rocks  or reefs , sink during a pirate attack, or 
be dragged  underwater by a sea  monster. A storm orhungry 
dragon can  lay waste to an  airship just as  easily. A shipwreck 
has the potential to change the direction of a campaign . It 
isn't,  however, a particularly good way to kill  off characters  or 
end  a campaign . 

If you  and  your campaign conspire to wreck a ship on 
which the characters  are traveling,  it is  assumed that the 
characters  survive with the equipment they were wearing or 
carrying still  in  their possession. The fate of any  N PCs  and 
cargo  aboard the wrecked  ship is entirely up to you.

WEATHER AT  S EA 
Use the Weather table earlier in this chapter when 
checking for weather at sea. 

If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind 
and heavy rain, they combine to  create a storm with 
high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all 
landmarks (unless there's a lighthouse or other bright 
feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the 
storm have disadvantage.

THE  SKY 
Flying characters can move from one place to another in 
a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters 
that can't fly or that lack ranged attacks. 

Flying by spell or magic item works the same as 

travel on foot, as described in the Player's Handbook. A 
creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour 
for every 3 hours it flies , and it can't fly for more than 
9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on griffons 
(which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 
miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 
1-hour-long rests over the course of the day.  Mounts that 
don't tire (such as a flying construct) aren't subject to 
this limitation. 

In a dead calm (no wind), ships can't move under sail 
and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind 
moves at half speed. 

ISIBILITY 

A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a 
crow's nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a 
oastline up to  10 miles away, assuming clear skies. 
Overcast skies reduce that distance by half. Rain and 
-og reduce visibility just as they do on land. 

OWNING A  SHIP 
At some point in your campaign, the adventurers 
might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or 
capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It's 
up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and 
you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a 
hip at any time should it become a nuisance (see the 
-Shipwrecks" sidebar). 

Crew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to 
"unction. As per the Player 's Handbook, one skilled 
hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum 
number of ski lled hirelings needed to crew a ship 
depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne 
and Waterborne Vehicles table. 

You can track the loyalty of individual crew members 
or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules 
in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal 
during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a 
mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members 
leave the ship and never return. 

Passengers. The table indicates the number of Small 

and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. 
Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight 
quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations 
can carry one-fifth as many passengers. 

A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day 

for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A 
mall private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day. 
Cargo. The table indicates  the maximum tonnage 

each kind of ship can carry. 

Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all 

damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes 
damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or 
exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial 
and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points. 

Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made 

. hile the vessel is berthed.  Repairing 1 hit point of 
amage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials 
and labor.

result that indicates a non-flying monster, unless the 
characters are flying close enough to the ground to be 
targeted by non-flying creatures making ranged attacks. 
Characters have normal chances to spot creatures on 
the ground and can decide whether to engage them. 

TRAPS 
Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step 
in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything 
blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The 
seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave 
entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes 
through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop 
on travelers who pass underneath. In the D&D game, 
unwary adventurers can fall  to  their deaths, be burned 
alive, or fall  under a fusillade of poisoned darts. 
A trap can be either mechanical or magical in 

nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow 
traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling 
blades, and anything else that depends on 
a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either 
magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device 
traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps 
are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that 
function as traps. 

CHAPTER 5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

SIN PLAY 

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know 
how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the 
possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to 
disable or avoid it. 

TRIGGERING A  TRAP 
Most traps are triggered when a creature goes 
somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator 
wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on 
a pressure plate or a false section of floor,  pulling a trip 
wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a 
lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature 
enters an area or touches an object. Some magic 
traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more 
complicated trigger conditions, including a password 
that prevents the trap from activating. 

DETECTING AND  DISABLING A  TRAP 
Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful 
inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone 
that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off 
a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which 
jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something 
that points to a trap's presence. 

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs 

needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character 

actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom 
(Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can 
also compare the DC to detect the trap with each 
character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to 
determine whether anyone in the party notices the 
trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before 
triggering it, they might be able to  disarm it, either 
permanently or long enough to move past it. You might 
call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a 
character to  deduce what needs to be done, followed 
by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the 
necessary sabotage. 

Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) 
check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to 
any other checks noted in the trap's description. The 
DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In 
addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most 
magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC 
for the ability check made when you use dispel magic. 

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough 
that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions 
locate or foil  the trap. As with many situations, you 
shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and 
good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the 
trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's 
design can anticipate every possible action that the 
characters might attempt. 

You should allow a character to discover a trap 

without making an ability check if an action would 
clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a 
character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, 
rhe character has found the trigger and no check 
is required. 

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. 

Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened 
without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a 
mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward 
anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and 
making a few checks, the characters are still unsure 
if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they 
prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at 
a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still 
rriggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into 
the shield. 

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow 
them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters 
that place traps in or around their lairs need ways 
ro get past those traps without harming themselves. 

uch traps might have hidden levers that disable their 
triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that 
goes around the trap. 

T RAP  EFFECTS 
The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to 
deadly,  making use of elements such as arrows, 
- pi kes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, 

and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple 
elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature 
unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description 
specifies what happens when it is triggered. 

The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its 

effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on 
the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack 
Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table 
for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity. 

A trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill 

or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, 
whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure 
(and potentially kill) characters of the indicated 
levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the 
indicated levels.

COMPLEX TRAPS 
Complex traps work like standard traps, except once 
activated they execute a series of actions each round. A 
complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap 
into something more like a combat encounter. 

When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The 

trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its 
turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It 
might make successive attacks against intruders, create 

APTER  5  I ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

l~l 

an effect that changes over time. or otherwi  e produce a 
dynamic cha llenge.  Otherw ise, the complex trap can be 
detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways. 

For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly 

flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, 
the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is 
completely flooded . 

SAMPLE TRAPS 
The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary 
in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. 

COLLAPSING ROOF 
Mechanical trap 
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports 
keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place. 

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches 

between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip 
wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using 
thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A 
character without thieves' tools can attempt this check 
with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged 
tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. 

Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine 

that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, 
a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap 
to trigger. 

The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, 

and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger 
of collapse. 

When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling 

collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable 
section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once 
the trap is \riggered, the floor of the area is filled with 
rubble and becomes difficult terrain. 

FALLING ~~T 

Mechanical trap 
This trap uses\

. 

trip wire to release a net suspended 

The trip wire,is'J~nches off the ground and stretches 

between two column~r trees. The net is hidden by 
cobwebs or foliage. The IJC to spot the trip wire and net 
is 10. A successful DC 15 D~~rity check using thieves' 
tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character 
without thieves' tools can attem~ this check with 
disadvantage using any edged wea!'lon or edged tool. On 
a failed check, the trap triggers. 

When the trap is triggered, the net is released , 

covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are 
trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail 
a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. 
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength 
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach 
on a success. The net has AC  10 and 20 hit points. 
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC  10) destroys a 
5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped 
in that section. 

CHAPTE R  5  \  ADVENTURE  ENVIRONMENTS 

fiRE - BREATHL"G  --..,_~  ~ 
Magic trap 
This  trap is activated when an in- de-
hidden pressure plate,  relea  ina a magical gout of fl ame 
from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, 
including a dragon or a wizard casting a s pell. 

tep  on a 

The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as 
faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or 
other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such 
as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic 
around the statue. 

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 
weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the 
statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire.  Each creature 
in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A 
successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue 
destroys the trap. 

PITS 
Mechanical trap 
Four basic pit traps are presented here. 

Simple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the 

ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on 
the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris. 

The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the 

cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, 
taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, 
but some pits are deeper). 

Hidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from 

material identical to the floor around it. 

A successful DC  15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section 
of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to 
confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the 
cover of a pit. 

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open 

like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the 
pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can 
be deeper. 

Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar 

object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the 
surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover 
from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover 
can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock 
spell or similar magic. 

Locking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit 
trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers 
the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, 
the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. 

A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to 

pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open 
(determine the cover's statistics using the guidelines 
in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to 
disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 

15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the 
mechanism can be reached and the character can see. 
In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a 
secret door nearby) opens the pit. 

Spiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or 

locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes 
at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 
(2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to 
any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison 
smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking 
piercing damage from the spikes must also make a 
DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 

POISON  DARTS 
Mechanical trap 
When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, 
poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or 
pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding 
walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, 
each one rigged to  its own set of darts. 

The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and 

cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or 
frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC tq spot them is 
15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a character can deduce the presence of the 
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and 
stone used to create it, compared to  the surrounding 
floor.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing 
the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained 
within from launching. 

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 

weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four 
darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus 
against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure 
plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are 
no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A 
target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must 
ucceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 
11  (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 

PO ISON  NEEDLE 
J1echanical trap 
A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's 
lock,  or in something else that a creature might open. 
Opening the chest without the proper key causes the 
needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison. 

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 
mches straight out from the lock. A creature within 
range takes 1 piercing damage and 11  (2d10) poison 
am age, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
-aving throw or be poisoned for  1 hour. 

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check 

allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from 
al£erations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. 
_ _,_  uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' 

tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from 
the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock 
triggers the trap. 

ROLLING  SPHERE 
Mechanical trap 
When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this 
trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling 
opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of 
solid stone. 

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, 

a cb.aracter can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate . . 
A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations 
in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's 
presence. The same check made while inspecting the 
ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the 
trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under 
the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. 

Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present 

to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 
bonus. On its turn, it  moves 60 feet in a straight line. 
The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and 
creatures can move through its space, treating it as 
difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's 
space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, 
that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be 
knocked prone. 

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. 

It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders 
incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages 
that allow the sphere to keep moving. 

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can 

attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. 
On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 
15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving 
and is no longer a threat. 

SPHERE  OF ANNIHILATION 
Magic trap 
Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth 
of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in 
diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, 
no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter 
that enters it is instantly obliterated. 

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check 

reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation 
that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise 
identical to a normal sphere of annihilation, as 
described in chapter 7,  "Treasure." 

Some versions of the trap include an enchantment 

placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures 
feel an overwhelming urge to  approach it and crawl 
inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the 
sympathy aspect of the antipathy/ sympathy spell. 
A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this 
enchantment.

CHAPTER 6:  BETWEEN ADVENTURES 

CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE THAN A SERIES OF 
adventures. It also includes the moments 
between them-the various distractions and 
side pursuits that engage the characters 
when they're not exploring the wilderness, 
plundering dungeons, and gallivanting 

around the multiverse on some epic quest. 

The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between 

adventures, time for the characters to spend their 
treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives 
the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little 
deeper into the world, building a personal investment 
in what happens to the people and places around them, 
which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures. 

Chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook 

details the expenses that a character incurs for 
basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the 
character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 
8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of 
the downtime activities they can pursue between 
adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing 
the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and 
a variety of additional downtime activities characters 
can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers 
suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping 
track of events in your campaign. 

LINKING ADVENTURES 
A campaign in the style of an episodic television show 
rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each 
adventure features its own villains, and once the 
characters complete the adventure, there are typically 
no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents 
an altogether different challenge having nothing to do 
with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters 
gain experience points, they become more powerful, 
as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of 
campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort 
beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for 
the party's level. 

A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as 
though their actions have far-reaching consequences. 
They're not just racking up experience points. A few 
simple modifications can help you overlay overarching 
elements to create a serialized campaign in which early 
adventures help set up later ones. 

USING AN  0VERARCHING  STORY 
This section presents a couple of examples of 
overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled 
many classic D&D campaigns. 

The adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass 

the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that 
threatens the world. Their goal in the second example 
is to defend something they care about by destroying 
whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, 
the same story (variations of the battle between good 
and evil) told in different ways. 

EXAMPLE 1:  THE  QUEST OF  MANY PARTS 
You  can tie adventures together using an overarching 
goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series 
of related quests. For example, you could create a villain 
who can't be defeated until the characters explore nine 
dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with 
each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters 
and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three 
levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers 
fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing 
an epic quest to  destroy the princes' monstrous 
progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and 
interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus 
of the campaign. 

In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers 

might need to collect fragments of an artifact that 
are scattered in ruins across the multi verse, before 
reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a 
cosmic threat. 

ExAMPLE 2: AGENTS  OF X 
You  can also build a campaign around the idea that 
the adventurers are agents of something larger than 
themselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for 
example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers 
are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting 
whatever it is they serve. 

The characters' overarching mission might be to 

explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances 
where they can and overcoming threats they encounter 
along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient 
capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm 
of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile 
territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search 
of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated 
to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever(cid:173)
declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, 
striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil 
leaders and plundering its treasures. 

PLANTING ADVENTURE  SEEDS 
You can make a campaign feel like one story with many 
chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure 
before the current one is finished. This technique can 
naturally moves the characters along to their next goal. 

If you've planted a seed well, the characters have 
something else to do when they finish an adventure. 
Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a 
dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to 
the next quest. The party might find  a cryptic map or 
relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, 
points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns 
the characters of impending danger or implores 
them for help. 

The trick is to not distract the characters from the 
adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a 
future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be 
compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop 
caring about what their characters are doing right now. 

CHAPTER 6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES 

125 

To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for 

the very end of your adventures, or insert them during 
periods of downtime. 

Here are a few examples of ways in which an 

adventure seed can be revealed: 

On a villain's corpse, the characters find  evidence that 
the villain was working for someone else. 
A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or 
something that might interest the characters. 
The characters are heading to a local tavern when 
they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster 
(complete with the promise of a sizable reward). 

•  Members of the local militia or city watch put out the 

word that a crime has been committed, and they're 
looking for potential witnesses and suspects. 

•  The characters receive an anonymous letter that 

sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they 
were previously unaware. 

FORESHADOWING -------------------

Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the 
delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all 
foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are 
too subtle or if events conspire to  take your campaign 
in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint 
at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign 
without making it obvious to players that you're telling 
them what the future holds. Here are a few examples: 

•  An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol 

of a previously unknown organization engraved or 
written on it. 
A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts 
fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a 
crooked finger at the characters. 
The king and queen announce the marriage of their 
son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but 
various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing. 
Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized 
lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a 
hobgoblin warlord's invasion. 

· 

•  A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic 

outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring 
war on each other refuse to reconcile. 
NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a 
similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat 
to the player characters. 

CAMPAIGN TRACKING 
Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and 
continuity helps players imagine that their characters 
are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent 
a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, 
and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the 
next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the 
characters' actions or of actions they learn about. When 
the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless 
someone raises it. When they remove treasure from 
a room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter(cid:173)
assuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a 
door open, it should Stay open until someone closes it. 

CHAPTER 6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES 

No one's memory is infallible, so it pays to  keep 
records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to 
keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. 
Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are be 
recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. 
Whether it's a physical book or a n electronic file , such_ 
record is a great way to keep your notes organized. 

Your notebook might include a ny of the 

following elements. 

Campaign Planner. Write down the main story arc 
your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope 
appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaigr:. 
develops, adding ideas as they come to you. 

Character Notes. Write down the characters' 

backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you 
design adventure content that provides opportunities ~ 
character development. 

Keep a running tally of the adventurers' classes and 

levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities 
they're engaged in. 

If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record iL 
name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the 
characters' employ. 

Player Handouts. Keep a copy of all handouts 

you make for your players so that you don't have to 
remember their contents later. 

Adventure Log. Think of this log as an episode guide 

for your campaign. Summarize each game session 
or adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding 
campaign story. You can give your players access to thE 
log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your nor  · 
and secrets. (The players might also keep their own 
record of adventures, which you can refer to if your ow(cid:173)
log is incomplete.) 

NPC Nqtes. Record statistics and roleplaying notes 

for any NPC the characters interact with more than 
once. For example, your notes might differentiate 
important people in a town by their different voices, 
as well as their names, the places where they live 
and work, the names of their family members and 
associates, and maybe even a secret that each one 
of them has. 

Campaign Calendar. Your world feels more real to 

your players when the characters notice the passage of 
time. Note details such as the change of seasons and 
major holidays, and keep track of any important event 
that affect the larger story. 

Toolbox. Keep notes whenever you create or 

significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep 
any maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create. 
This information ensures you won't repeat your work. 
and you'll be able to  draw on this material later. 

RECURRING EXPENSES 
Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a 
particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional 
drains on their adventuring income. Player characters 
who come into possession of property, own businesses. 
and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that 
accompany these ventures.

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
The campaign benefits when characters have time 
between adventures to engage in other activities. 
Allowing days, weeks, or months to  pass between 
adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period 
of time and helps to manage the characters' level 
progression, preventing them from gaining too much 
power too quickly. 

Allowing characters to pursue side interests between 

adventures also encourages players to become more 
invested in the campaign world. When a character owns 
a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the 
locals, that character's player is more likely to respond 
to threats to the village and its inhabitants. 

As your campaign progresses, your players' 

characters will not only become more powerful but also 
more influential and invested in the world. They might 
be inclined to undertake projects that require more time 
between adventures, such as building and maintaining a 
stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more 
downtime between adventures to give characters the 
time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days 
or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the 
amount of downtime between higher-level adventures 
might be measured in months or years.

CRAFTING A  MAGIC  ITEM 
Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how 
they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you 
can allow player characters to craft magic items. 

The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive 

task. To start, a character must have a formula that 
describes the construction of the item. The character 
must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must 
be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. 
Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum 
determined by the item's rarity,  as shown in the Crafting 
Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character 
could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon 
item), as long as the character has spell slots and can

Chapter 8, ··Adventuring:· of the Player·  Handbook 
describes a few downtime activities to fill the Yoid 
between adventures. Depending on the style of your 
campa ign and the particular backgrounds and interests 
of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the 
following additional activities available as options. 

B U I LDI NG A  STRONGHO LD 
A character can spend time between adventures 
building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the 
character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies 
within a kingdom or similar domain, the character 
will need a royal charter (a legal document granting 
permission to oversee the estate in the name of the 
crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing 
custody of the land to the character for as long as he 
or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a  legal 
document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can 
also be acquired by inheritance or other means. 

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by 

the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they 
can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A 
small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much 
as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, 
if it can be bought at all. 

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access 

to building materials and laborers. The Building 
a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the 
stronghold (including materials and labor) and the 
amount of time it takes, provided that the character 
is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can 
continue while the character is away, but each day the 
character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

CARO USING 
Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a 
variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, 
binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps 
them cope with the perils they face on their adventures. 

A carousing character spends money as though 

maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, 
"Equipment,"  of the Player's Handbook). At the end of 
the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile 
dice and adds the character's level, then compares the 
total to the Carousing table to determine what happens 
to the character, or you choose.

a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular 
spell required. 

You can decide that certain items also require special 

materials or locations to be created. For example, a 
character might need alchemist's supplies to brew a 
particular potion, or the formula for a flame  tongue 
might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting 
_ Iagic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting 
of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, 
-pending that amount for each day of work until the 
·oral cost is paid. The character is ass limed to work for 8 
._,ours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon 
;:nagic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You  are free to 
adjust the costs to better suit your campaign. 

If a spell will be produced by the item being created, 

-·  e creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's 

,-eJ for each day of the creation process. The spell's 

::::~arerial components must also be at hand throughout

;:omponents, they are consumed by the creation process.

nsumed once each day of the item's creation. 
_ Iultiple characters can combine their efforts to

an contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent

-~ares a magic item described in chapter 7,  "Treasure." 
-- _ our discretion, you can allow players to design their 

magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, 

~ungeon Master's Workshop." 

':hile crafting a magic item, a character can maintain 
odest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, 

-a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see 
-prer 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook). 

PERFORMING  SACRED  RITES 
A pious character can spend time between adventures 
performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god 
he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends 
time in meditation and prayer. 

A character who is a priest in the temple can lead 

these rites, which might include weddings, funerals , and 
ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple 
or assist a priest with a rite. 

A character who spends at least 10 days performing 

sacred rites gains inspiration (described in chapter 4 of 
the Player's Handbook) at the start of each day for the 
next 2d6 days. 

RUNNING A  BUSINESS 
Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have 
nothing to  do with delving into dungeons or saving the 
world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party 
might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a 
reward. If they hold on to  the business, they might feel 
obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining 
the venture and making sure it runs smoothly. 

A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number 
of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), 
then compares the total to  the Running a Business table 
to determine what happens. 

If the character is required to  pay a cost as a result 
of rolling on this table but fails to  do so, the business 
begins to fail.  For each unpaid debt incurred in this 
manner, the character takes a - 10 penalty to subsequent 
rolls made on this table.

·  ·iries for a combined number of days equal to his

~m increases by 1. 

SELLING MAGIC  ITEMS 
Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer 
still know how to find  one. Adventurers are exceptional 
in this regard due to the nature of their profession. 

A character who comes into possession of a common, 

uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or 
she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a 
buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in 
a city or another location where one can find wealthy 

CHAPTER  6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES 

T29 

individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary 
magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during 
downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be 
the substance of an adventure or quest. 

For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 

Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another 
character can use his or her downtime to assist with the 
search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed 
check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that 
lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the 
item is found after a number of days based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table. 

A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple 
magic items at once. Although this requires multiple 
Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches a~e 
occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple 
failures or successes aren't added together. For 
example, if the character finds a buyer for a common 
magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item 
in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for 
grabs, the entire search takes 10 days. 

For each item a character wishes to sell, the player 
rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic 
Item table, applying a modifier based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The 
character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
and adds that check's total to the roll. The subsequent 
total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item. 

You determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes 

procure rare and very rare items through proxies to 
ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the 
buyer is shady, it's up to you whether the sale creates 
legal complications for the party later.

S OWING R UMORS 

waying public opinion can be an effective way to bring 

down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors 
is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that 
goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's 
- randing in a community or embroil someone in 
scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard 
o disprove. An effective r umor also has to be believable, 
playing off what people want to believe about the person 
in question. 

Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization 
-equires a number of days depending on the size of the 
community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a 
own or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the 
character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on 
an adventure for another few days and then returns, 
rhe rumor fades away without the benefit of constant 
:-epetition.

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover 

- e cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. 
_ r the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the 
-haracter must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception 
r Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the 
community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts 
ne step toward friend ly or hostile, as the character 
ishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, 

and further attempts to propagate it fail. 

Shifting a community's general attitude toward 
a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in 
- e community. Individuals might hold to their own 
pinions, particularly if they have personal experience 
'"'  dealing with the subject of the rumors. 

-RAINING TO  GAIN LEVELS 

- a variant rule, you can require characters to spend 

:.owntime training or studying before they gain the 

oefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a 
aracter has earned enough experience points to attain 

"'  new level, he or she must train for a number of days

The training time required depends on the level to be

CREATING D OWNTIME AC T IVITIES 
Your players might be interested in pursuing downtime 
activities that aren't covered in this chapter or in 
the Player's Handbook. If you invent new downtime 
activities, remember the following: 

An activity should never negate the need or desire for 
characters to go on adventures. 
Activities that have a monetary cost associated with 
them provide opportunities for player characters to 
spend their hard-won treasure. 
Activities that reveal new adventure hooks and 
previously unknown facts about your campaign can 
help you foreshadow future events and conflicts. 
For an activity you expect a character to  repeat 
with variable degrees of success, consider creating 
a random outcome table, modeled on the ones in 
this chapter. 

•  If a character belongs to a class or has a proficiency or 

background that would make him or her well suited 
to a particular activity, consider granting a bonus to 
ability checks made by the character to complete that 
activity successfully. 

CHAPTER 6  I BETWEEN  ADVENTURES 

CHAPTER 7:  TREASURE 

DVENTURERS STRIVE FOR MAN Y THINGS, 
including glory, knowledge, a nd justice. 
Many adventurers also seek something more 
tangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains, 
stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, 
enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and 

powerful magic items all wait to be seized or unearthed 
by intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers. 

This chapter details magic items and the placement of 
treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that 
can be granted instead of or in addition to magic items 
a nd  mundane treasure. 

TYPES  OF TREASURE 
Treasure comes in many forms . 

Coins. The most basic type of treasure is money, 

including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp),  electrum 
pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). 
Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound. 

Gemstones. Gemstones are small, lightweight, and 
easily secured compared to their same value in coins. 

ee the "Gemstones" section for types of stones, gems, 

and jewels that can be found as treasure. 

Art Objects. Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces 
tudded with precious stones, paintings of ancient 
kings, bejeweled dishes- art objects include all these 
a nd more. See the "Art Objects" sectiori for types of 
decorative and valuable artworks that can be found 
as treasure. 

Magic Items. Types of magic items include armor, 
potions , scrolls, rings , rods, staffs, wands, weapons, 
a nd wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: 
common , uncommon, rare, very ra re, and legendary. 
Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their 

possession, while others might hide them away to 
ensure they don't get lost or stolen. For example, if a 
hobgoblin tribe has a +llongsword and an alchemy jug 
in its treasure hoard, the tribe's warlord might wield the 
word , while the jug is kept somewhere safe. 

RANDOM TREASURE 
The following pages contain tables that you can use 
to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters, 
tashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The 
placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key 
is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, 
and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming 
dangerous challenges. 

TREASURE TABLES 
Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a 
monster's challenge rating. There are tables for 
challenge rating 0- 4, challenge rating 5- 10, challenge 
rating 11- 16, and challenge rating 17  and higher. Use 
these tables to  randomly determine how much money 
a n individual monster carries (the D&D equivalent of 
pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger 
treasure hoard. 

' 

US ING THE  INDIVIDUA L TREASURE TABLES 
An  Individual Treasure table helps you  randomly 
determine how much treasure one creature carries on 
its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing 
treasure, you can use this table to determine the 
incidental treasure left behind by the monster's victims. 
Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to 
the monster's challenge rating. Roll  a dlOO, and read the 
result across to determine how many coins of each type 
the monster carries. The table also includes the average 
result in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another 
roll and save time. To determine the total amount of 
individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you 
can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result 
by the number of creatures in the group. 

If it doesn't make sense for a monster to carry a large 
pile of coins, you can convert the coins into gemstones 
or art objects of equal value. 

USING THE TREASURE  HOARD TABLES 
A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine 
the contents of a large cache of treasure, the 
accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such 
as an ore tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of 
a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure 
(such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party 
after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also 
split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't 
find  or receive it all at once. 

When determining the contents of a hoard belonging 

to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that 
monster's challenge rating. When rolling to determine a 
treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, 
use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the 
group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge 
rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon 
or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a 
benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to  the party's 
average level. 

Every treasure hoard contains a random number of 

coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a dlOO and 
consult the table to determine how many gemstones or 
art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll 
to determine whether the hoard contains magic items. 
As with the individual treasure tables, average values 
are given in parentheses. You  can use an average value 
instead of rolling dice to save time. 

If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll 
multiple times on the table. Use this approach for 
monsters that are particularly fond of amassing 
treasure.  Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure 
are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on 
the appropriate table and add the results together. 

You can ha nd out as much or as little treasure as you 

want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party 
finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the 
Challenge 0- 4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 
5- 10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11- 16 table, 
a nd eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.

GEMSTONES 
If a treasure hoard includes gemstones , you can use 
the following tables to  randomly determine the kind 
of gemstones found , based on their value. You can roll 
once and assume all the gems are the same, or roll 
multiple times to create mixed collections of gemstones.

MAGIC  ITEMS 
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered 
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such 
items grant capabilities a character could rarely 
have otherwise,  or they complement their owner's 
capabilities in wondrous ways. 

RARITY 
Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, 
rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, 
such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some 
legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are 
unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating 
the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were 
then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and 
mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. 
Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. 

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power 
relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds 
to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity  . 
table. A character doesn't typically find  a rare magic 
item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, 
rarity shou ldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. 
If you want a ring of invisibility to fall into the hands of 
a  1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will 
arise from that event. 

If your campaign allows for trade in magic items, 

rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, 
you determine the value of an individual magic item 
based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in 
the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable 
item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value 
of a permanent item of the same rarity.

BUYING AND  SELLING 
Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise, 
most magic items are so rare that they aren't available 
for purchase. Common items, such as a potion of 
healing,  can be procured from an alchemis t, herbalist, 
or spellcaster. Doing so is ra rely as simple as walking 
into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller 
might ask for a service, rather than coin. 

In a large city with an academy of magic or a major 

temple, buying and selling magic items might be 
possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a 
large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving 
ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more 
common. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to  the 
market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only 
auctions and a tendency to attract thieves. 

Selling magic items is difficult in most D&D worlds 
primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. 

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

135 

Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but 
few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an 
item usually have more practical things to spend on. See 
chapter 6, "Between Adventures," for one way to handle 
selling magic items. 

In your campaign, magic items might be prevalent 
enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with 
some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or 
auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City 
of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more 
ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly 
regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. 
Artificers might craft items for use by military forces 
or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You 
might also allow characters to craft their own magic 
items, as discussed in chapters 6. 

IDENTIFYING A  MAGIC  ITEM 
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their 
nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items 
display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a 
magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to 
give a character a sense that something is extraordinary 
about it.  Discovering a magic item's properties isn't 
automatic, however. 

The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an 

item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus 
on one magic item during a short rest, while being in 

INDIVIDUAL  TREASURE:  CHALLENGE  0-4 

physica l contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the 
character learns the item's properties, as well as how 
to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is 
enough to tell the taster what the potion does. 
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its 

properties. The command word to  activate a ring mighr 
be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design 
might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling. 

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer 

hints about its properties. For example, if a character 
puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, "Your steps fee 
strangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps 
up and down to see what happens. You  then say the 
character jumps unexpectedly high. 

VARIANT:  MORE  DIFFICULT IDENTIFICATION 
If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, 
consider removing the ability to identify the properties 
of a magic item during a short rest, and require the 
identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a 
magic item does. 

ATTUNEMENT 
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond 
with them before their magical properties can be used. 
This bond is called attunement, and certain items 
have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, 
a creature must be a member of that class to attune to 
the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster

qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that 
class's spell list.) 

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires 

attunement, a creature gains only its non magical 
benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For 
example, a magic shield that requires attunement 
provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not 
attuned to it, but none of its magical properties. 

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend 

a short rest focused on only that item while being in 
physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest 
used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take 
the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation 
(for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate 
activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement 
attempt fails.  Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, 
the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to 
activate any magical properties of the item, including 
any necessary command words. 

TREASURE  HOARD:  CHALLENGE  11-16 

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a r.ir 
and a creature can be attuned to no more than three 
magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fou;(cid:173)
item fails ; the creature must end its attunement to ill! 
item first.  Additionally, a creature can't attune to mo-(cid:173)
than one copy of an item. For example, a creature ca.:; 
attune to more than one ring of protection at a time. 
A creature's attunement to  an item ends if the ere<:: 

no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement. 
the item has been more than 100 feet away for at le~ 
24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature 
attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

i  cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including 
rhe identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although 
ore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to  the 
item's user when the curse's effects are revealed. 

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily 
unless the curse is broken first, such as with the remove 
curse spell. 

.YfAGIC  ITEM  CATEGORIES 
Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, 
potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or 
"'"ondrous items. 

_-\RM OR 
-nless an armor's description says otherwise, armor 
must be worn for its magic to function. 

Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor 
;hey are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor 
doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type 
or determine it randomly. 

P OTIONS 
Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the 
category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, 
water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and 
oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions 
consist of one ounce of liquid. 

Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a 

potion or administering a potion to another character

CP 

requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as 
specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes 
effect immediately, and it is used up. 

RINGS 
Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to  those 
lucky enough to find  them. Unless a ring's description 
says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a 
similar digit, for the ring's magic to function. 

RODS 
A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is 
typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It's about 2 or 3 
feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to  5 pounds. 

SCROLLS 
Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while 
a few bear unique incantations that produce potent 
wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, 
sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept 
safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. 

A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the 
nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing 
that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. 
When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be 
used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust. 

Any creature that can understand a written language 

can read the arcane script on a scroll and attempt to 
activate it.

STAFFS 
A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely 
in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter 
throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, 
some are made of wood, and others are composed of 
polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a 
staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. 

Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can 

be used as a quarterstaff. 

WANDS 
A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of 
metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, 
stone, or some other material. 

WEAPONS 
Whether crafted for some fell  purpose or forged to 
serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are 
coveted by many adventurers. 

Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon 

they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or 

VARIANT:  MIXING  POTIONS 
A character might drink one potion while still  under the 
effects of another, or pour several  potions into a single 
container. The strange ingredients  used  in  creating potions 
can  result in  unpredictable interactions. 

When  a character mixes two  potions together, you  can 
roll  on  the  Potion  Miscibility table.  If more than two  are 
combined,  roll  again  for  each  subsequent potion , combining 
the results.  Unless the effects are  immediately obvious, 
reveal  them only when  they become evident.

Result 
The mixture creates a magical explosion, 
dealing 6d10 force  damage to the  mixer and 
1d10 force damage to each creature within  5 
feet of the mixer. 
The mixture becomes an  ingested  poison of 
the OM 's choice. 
Both  potions lose their effects. 
One potion  loses  its  effect. 
Both  potions work,  but with their numerical 
effects and durations halved.  A potion  has  no 
effect if it can't be  halved  in  this way. 
Both  potions work  normally. 
The  numerical  effects and  duration of one 
potion are doubled.  If neither potion  has 
anything to double in  this way,  they work 
normally. 
Only one potion works,  but its effect is 
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to 
make  permanent, or the one that seems 
the  most fun.  For example, a potion of 
healing might increase the drinker's hit point 
maximum  by 4,  or oil of etherealness might 
permanently trap the user in  the Ethereal 
Plane. At your discretion,  an  appropriate 
spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, 
might end this lasting effect. 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon 
type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly. 

WONDROUS  ITEMS 
Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, 
belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and 
decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. 
Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical 
instruments, and other objects also fall  into this catch(cid:173)
all category. 

WEARING AND WIELDING  ITEMS 
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing 
or wielding it. A magic item meant to  be worn must be 
donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, 
gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and 
rings on the finger.  Magic armor must be donned, a 
shield strapped to  the arm, a cloak fastened about the 
shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand. 

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn 

can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many 
magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or the: 
magically adjust themselves to the wearer. 

Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good 

reason for an item to fit  only creatures of a certain 
size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For 
example, armor made by the drow might fit  elves only. 

VARIANT:  SCROLL  MISHAPS 
A creature who tries and  fails  to cast a spell  from  a spell scroll 
must make  a DC  10  Intelligence saving throw.  If the saving 
throw fails,  roll  on the Scroll  Mishap table. 

SCROLL  MISHAP

Result 
A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 
force  damage  per level  of the spell. 
The spell affects the caster or an  ally 
(determined  randomly)  instead of the intended 
target,  or it  affects a random target nearby if the 
caster was the intended target. 
The spell  affects a random  location within the 
spell's range. 
The spell's effect is  contrary to  its  normal one , 
but neither harmful  nor beneficial.  For instance, 
a fireball  might produce an  area of harmless 
cold. 
The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect 
related to the spell.  Such effects last only 
as  long as  the original spell's duration , or 
1d10  minutes for  spells that take effect 
instantaneously.  For example,  a fireball  might 
cause smoke to  billow from  the caster's ears for 
1d10  minutes. 
The spell  activates after 1d12  hours.  If the 
caster was the  intended target, the spell takes 
effect normally.  If the caster was  not the 
intended target, the spell goes off in  the general 
direction of the intended target,  up to the spell 's 
maximum  range, ifthe target has  moved away. 

Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized 
and dwarf-shaped characters. 

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your 
discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. 
A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti 
with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots. 

MU LTIPLE  ITEMS  OF THE  SAME  KIND 
Use common sense to determine whether more than 
one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A 
character can't normally wear more than one pair of 
footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of 
bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and 
one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might 
be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or 
be able to layer two cloaks. 

PAIRED  I T EMS 
Items that come in pairs- such as boots, bracers, 
gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both 
items of the pair are worn. For example, a character 
wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and 
a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit 
from either item. 

AC TIVAT I NG A N  I TEM 
Activating some magic items requires a user to do 
omething special, such as holding the item and uttering 
a command word. The description of each item category 
or individual item details how an item is activated. 
Certain items use one or more of the following rules for 
their activation. 

If an item requires an action to activate, that action 
isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature 
such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to 
activate  the item. 

C OMMAND WORD 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be 
poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires 
a command word can't be activated in an area where 
ound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. 

C ONSUMABLES 
S ome items are used up when they are activated. A 
potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied 
to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is 
read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. 

MAGIC  ITEM  FORMULAS 
A magic item formula explains how to make a particular 
magic item . Such a formula can  be an  excellent reward  if you 
allow player characters to craft magic items,  as  explained  in 
ch apter 6, "Between Adventures." 

You  can award  a formula  in  place of a magic  item.  Usually 

written  in  a book or on  a scroll , a formula  is  one step rarer 
tha n the item  it  allows  a character to create. For example, 
the formula for a common  magic item  is  uncommon . No 
fo rmulas exist for  legendary item s. 

If the creation of magic items  is  commonplace in  your 
ca mpaign, a formula  can  have a rarity that matches the 
rarity of the item  it  allows a character to create. Formulas for 
common and  uncommon items  might even  be for  sale, each 
with  a cost double that of its  magic  item. 

SPELLS 
S ome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell 
level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and 
requires no components, unless the item's description 
says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, 
range, and duration , and the user of the item must 
concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many 
items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell 
and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. 
Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing 
the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. 
A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require 
you to use your own spellcasting ability when you 
cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one 
spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with 
the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps 
you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your 
spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your 
proficiency bonus does apply. 

CHARGES 
Some magic items have charges that must be expended 
to activate their properties. The number of charges an 
item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell 
is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. 
Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature 
attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. 

MAGIC  I T EM  R ESILI ENCE 
Most magic items are objects of extraordinary 
artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting 
and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as 
durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic 
items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance 
to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, 
requiring extraordinary measures to destroy. 

SPECIAL FEATURES 
You  can add distinctiveness to  a magic item by thinking 
about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything 
unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and 
how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks 
set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering 
these questions can help turn a generic magic item, 
such as a +llongsword, into a more flavorful discovery. 

The tables that follow can help you come up with 

answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. 
Some of the table entries make more sense for certain 
items than for others. Some magic items are made 
only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a cloak 
of elvenkind is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If 
you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, 
choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail 
as inspiration to make up your own. 

VARIANT:  WANDS THAT  DoN'T RECHARGE 
A typical wand  has expendable charges.  If you 'd like  wands to 
be a lim ited  resource, you  can  make  some of them  incapable 
of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of 
charges in  such  a wand , to a maximum of25 charges. These 
charges are  never regained once they're expended.

Waterborne. This  item floats  on  water and other 
liquids.  Its  bearer has advantage on  Strength 
(Athletics)  checks to  swim. 
Wicked. When the bearer is  presented with  an 
opportunity to  act in  a selfish or malevolent way, 
the item  heightens the bearer's urge to do so. 
Illusion. The item  is  imbued with  illusion  magic, 
allowing its  bearer to alter the item 's appearance in 
minor ways.  Such  alterations don't change how the 
item  is  worn , carried, or wielded,  and  they have  no 
effect on  its  other magical  properties.  For example, 
the wearer could  make a red  robe appear blue,  or 
make a gold  ring look  like  it 's made of ivory.  The 
item  reverts to  its true appearance when  no  one is 
carrying or wearing it. 
Roll  twice,  rerolling any additional  20s. 

Quirk 
Metamorphic. The item  periodically and  randomly 
alters  its  appearance in  slight ways. The  bearer has 
no  control over these minor alterations, which  have 
no effect on the item's  use. 
Muttering. The item  grumbles and  mutters . A 
creature who listens carefully to the item  might 
learn something useful. 
Painful. The  bearer experiences a harmless flash  of 
pain when  using the item. 
Possessive. The  item demands attunement when 
first wielded  or worn,  and  it doesn't allow  its 
bearer to  attune to other items.  (Other items 
already attuned to the bearer remain  so until their 
attunement ends.) 
Repulsive. The  bearer feels  a sense of distaste 
when  in  contact with  the item , and continues to 
sense discomfort while  bearing it. 
Slothful. The  bearer of this item feels  slothful  and 
lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer 
requires 10  hours to finish  a long rest.

MAGIC  ITEMS A-Z 
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A 
magic item's description gives the item's name, its 
category, its rarity, and its magical properties. 

ADAMANTINE ARMOR 
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide),  uncommon 
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one 
of the hardest substances in existence. While you're 
wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a 
normal hit. 

ALCHEMY jUG 
Wondrous item,  uncommon 
This ceramic jug appears to be able to  hold a gallon 
of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. 
Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when 
it is shaken, even if the jug is empty. 

You can use an action and name one liquid from the 

table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen 
liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action 
and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The 
maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends 
on the liquid you named. 

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce 

a different one, or more of one that has reached its 
maximum, until the next dawn.

AMMUNITION ,  +1 ,  +2,  OR +3 
Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or 
very rare (+3) 
You have a bonus to  attack and damage rolls made 
with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is 
determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hit 
a target, the ammunition is no longer magical. 

AMULET OF HEA LTH 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this 
amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is 
already 19 or higher. 

AMULET OF PROOF AGAINST DETECTION 
A ND  LOCATION 
Wondrous item,  uncommon (requires attunement) 
While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from 
divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or 
perceived through magical scrying sensors. 

AMULET OF THE  PLANES 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to 
name a location that you are familiar with on another 
plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence 
check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift 
spell. On a failure , you and each creature and object 
within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. 
Roll a dlOO.  On a 1- 60, you travel to a random location 
on the plane you named. On a 61- 100, you travel to a 
randomly determined plane of existence.

APPARATUS  OF  K W A LIS H 

ANIMATED  SHIELD 

ANIMATED  SHIELD 
Armor (shield),  very rare (requires atttinement) 
While holding this shield, you can speak its command 
word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield 
leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect 
you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. 
The shield remains animated for  1 minute, until you 
use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are 
incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls  to the 
ground or into your hand if you have one free. 

APPARATUS  OF KWALISH 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel 
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, 
which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a 
hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or 
smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in 
a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to 
move either up or down. When certain levers are used, 
the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. 
The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the 

following statistics: 
Armor Class: 20 
Hit Points: 200 
Speed: 30 ft.,  swim 30 ft.  (or 0 ft.  for both if the legs and 

tail aren't extended) 

Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. 
While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment 
is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds

ARMOR OF VULNERABILITY 
Armor (plate),  rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one 
of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, 
or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines 
it randomly. 

Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed 
only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you 
attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you 
are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic: 
removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed 
you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type 
associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants 
resistance). 

ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD 
Armor (shield),  rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while 
you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the 
shield's normal bonus to AC.  In addition, whenever an 
attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 
5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the 
target of the attack instead. 

ARROW OF  SLAYING 
Weapon (arrow),  very rare 
An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay 
a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused 
than others; for example, there are both arrows of 
dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a 
creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated 
with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, 
the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. 

Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a 

creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. 

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, 
such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though 
arrows are most common. 

BAG OF BEANS 
Wondrous item, rare 
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The 
bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean 
it contains. 

If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they 

explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. 
Each creature in the area, including you, must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren't being worn or carried. 

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or 

sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 
1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. 
The DM can choose an effect from the following table, 
determine it randomly, or create an effect.

chooses, such as to a great view,  a cloud giant's 
castle, or a different plane of existence.

BAG  OF 

DEVOURING 

BAG O F  DEVOURING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a 
feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. 
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. 

The extradimensional creature attached to  the bag 

can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or 
vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured 
and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed 
in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, 
there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled 
inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its 
action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength 
check. Another creature can use its action to reach into 
the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful 
DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the 
bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag 
is devoured, its body destroyed. 

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which 

can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once 
each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and 
spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM 
determines the time and plane. 

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and 

anything contained within it is transported to a random 
location on the Astral Plane. 

BAG  OF HOLDING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This bag has an interior space considerably larger 
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter 
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. 
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. 
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. 

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures 
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the

BEAD  OF  FORCE 
Wondrous item, rare 
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically,  1d4 + 4 beads 
of force are found together. 

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 
feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. 
Each creature within a  10-foot radius of where the bead 
landed must succeed on a DC  15 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent 
force then encloses the area for  1 minute. Any creature 
that failed the save and is completely within the area is 
trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded 
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed 

Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right 
before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside 
the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal 
to  10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 
minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. 

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable 
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. 

BAG  OF  TRICKS 
Wondrous item,  uncommon 
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, 
appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, 
reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag 
weighs 1/ 2 pound. 

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the 

bag and throw it up to  20 feet. When the object lands, 
it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling 
a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the 
bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's 
statistics. 

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, 
and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to 
command how the creature moves and what action it 
takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such 
as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, 
the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. 
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the 
bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are 
attuned to  this weapon, your hit point maximum 
increases by 1 for each level you have attained. 

Curse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it 
extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, 
you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within 
reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack 
rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe  is 
within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. 

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the 

axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you 
must use your action each round to  attack the creature 
nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra 
attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra 
attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after 
you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible 
targets, you attack one at random. You  are berserk until 
you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of 
you that you can see or hear. 

BOOTS  OF ELVENKIND 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound,

BOOTS  OF  SPEED 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action 
and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots 
double your walking speed, and any creature that makes 
an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on 
the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you 
end the effect. 

When the boots' property has been used for a total of 
10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish 
a long rest.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push 

against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half 
the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked 
up,  and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, 
regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits: 

Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a

In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 
percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard

beard if you already have one. 

If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional 

benefits while wearing the belt: 

You  have advantage on saving throws against poison, 
and you have resistance against poison damage. 
You  have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. 
You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.

feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed 
becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The 
broom stops hovering when you land. 

You can send the broom to travel alone to a 

destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the 
command word, name the location, and are familiar

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, 
which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the 
candle is destroyed. You  can snuff it out early for use at 
a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 
1 minute from the candle's total burn time. 

While lit,  the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot 

radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment 
matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving 
throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a 
cleric or druid in the light whose a lignment matches the 
candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared 
without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is 
as if cast with a  1st-level slot. 

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first

smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at

you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates 
at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind 
disperses the smoke. 

CARPET OF FLYING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
You can speak the carpet's command word as an action 
to make the carpet hover and fly.  It moves according to

area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be 
used again until the next dawn. 

CLOAK OF DISPLACEMENT 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that 
makes you appear to be standing in a place near 
your actual location, causing any creature to have 
disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take 
damage, the property ceases to function until the 
start of your next turn. This property is suppressed 
while you are in-capacitated, restrained, or otherwise 
unable to move.

you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action. 

CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) 
While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over 
your head to cause yourself to become invisible. While 
you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing

After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For 
every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes 
unused, it regains 1 hour of duration. 

CLOAK OF  PROTECTION

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or 
darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both 
hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever 
fail  to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if 
you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this 
flying speed. 

While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or 

darkness, you can use your action to cast polymorph on 
yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the 
form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way 
again until the next dawn.

CRYSTAL BALL 
Wondrous item, very rare or legendary 
(requires attunement) 
The typical crystal ball, a very rare 
item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While 
touching it, you can cast the scrying spell 
(save DC 17) with it. 

The following crystal ball variants are legendary 

items and have additional properties. 

Crystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action 
to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you 
are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you 
can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't 
need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain 
it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. 

Crystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the 

crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with 
creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's 
sensor. You can also use an action to  cast the suggestion 
spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those 
creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this 
suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends 
if scrying ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the 
crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn. 

Crystal Ball of True Seeing. While scrying with the 
crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet 
centered on the spell's sensor. 

CUBE OF FORCE 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a 
distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube 
starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended 
charges daily at dawn. 

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, 

expending a number of charges based on the chosen 
face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each 

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE

face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient 
charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a 
barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming 
a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, 
moves with you, and lasts for  1 minute, until you use an 
action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs 
out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by 
pressing a different face of the cube and expending the 
requisite number of charges, resetting the duration. 
If your movement causes the barrier to come into 

contact with a solid object that can't pass through the 
cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as 
the barrier remains.

CUBIC  GATE 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable 
magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each 
keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is 
the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to plane: 
determined by the DM. 

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to 
cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane 
keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to 
press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell 
(save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to 
the plane keyed to that side. 

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expend: 

1 charge. The cube regains ld3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 

DAERN'S  INSTANT FORTRESS 
Wondrous item, rare 
You  can use an action to place this l-inch metal cube 
on the ground and speak its command word. The cube 
rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use 
an action to speak the command word that dismisses ir. 
which works only if the fortress is empty. 

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side 

and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a 
battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors . 
with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. 
The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When 
activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing 
you. The door opens only at your command, which 
you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to  the 
knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime 
of opening. 

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears 

must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
lOdlO bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. In either case, 
the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside 
but next to  the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't 
being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed 
automatically . .

CUBIC  GATE 

DECANTER  OF 

E NDLESS  WATER 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

The tower is made of adamantine, a nd its magic 

prevents it from  being tipped over.  The roof, the door, 
and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to 
damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege 
weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a 
wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell 
counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each 
casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to 
regain 50 hit points. 

DAGGER OF VENOM 
Weapon (dagger),  rare 
You gain a +1  bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison 

to coat the blade. The poison remains for  1 minute 
or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. 
That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become 
poisoned for  1 minute. The dagger can't be used this 
way again until the next dawn. 

DANCING SWORD 
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement) 
You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into 
the air and speak the command word. When you do so, 
the sword begins to  hover, flies up to  30 feet, and attacks 
one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The 
-word uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to 
damage rolls. 

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to 
cause it to fly  up to  30 feet to another spot within 30 feet 
of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause 
rhe sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it. 

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it 
ies up to  30 feet and tries to  return to your hand. If you 
have no hand free , it falls to the ground at your feet. If 
the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as 
close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also 
ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet 
away from it. 

DECANTER OF ENDLESS WATER 
Wondrous item,  uncommon 
This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it 
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds. 

You  can use an action to remove the stopper and 
speak one of three command words, whereupon an 
amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours 
out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start 
of your next turn. Choose from the following options: 

"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water. 
"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water. 

•  "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes 
forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a 
bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim 
the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of 
you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall 
prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object 
that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no 
more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked 
over or pushed up to  15 feet away from you. 

DECK OF  ILLUSIONS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full 
deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually 
missing 1d20 - 1 cards. 

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are 

drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing 
cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to 
draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the 
ground at a point within 30 feet of you. 

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the 
thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory 
creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and 
behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the 
Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While 
you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and 
can see it, you can use an action to move it magically 
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical 
interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an 
illusion, because objects pass through it.  Someone who

it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears 
translucent. 

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion 

is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its 
card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

DECK OF MANY THINGS 
Wondrous item, legendary 
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains 
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 
percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the 
rest have twenty-two. 

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many 
cards you intend to  draw and then draw them randomly 
(you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate 
the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number 
have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card 
from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw 
each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. 
If you fail  to draw the chosen number, the remaining

Balance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, 

causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes 
chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are 
true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. 
Comet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile 
monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain 
experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, 
this card has no effect. 

Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a 
state of suspended animation in an extradimensional 
sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying 
stays behind in the space you occupied when you 
disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found 
and removed from the sphere. You  can't be located by 

A QUESTION  OF  ENMITY 
Two  of the cards  in  a deck of many things can earn a character 
the enmity of another being. With  the  Flames card, the 
enmity is  overt. The character should experience the devil's 
malevolent efforts on  multiple occasions. Seeking out the 
fiend  shouldn't be  a simple task, and the adventurer should 
clash with  the devil's  allies  and followers  a few times before 
being able to confront the devil  itself. 

In  the case of the  Rogue card, the enmity is  secret and 
should come from  someone thought to  be a friend  or an 
ally.  As  Dungeon  Master, you  should wait for a dramatically 
appropriate moment to reveal  this enmity,  leaving the 
adventurer guessing who  is  likely to become a betrayer.

location of your prison. You  draw no more cards. 

Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. 

You  take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in 
this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can 
end this curse. 

The Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, 

allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never 
happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you 
draw the card or at any other time before you die. 

Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The 

devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring 
your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity 
lasts until either you or the devil dies. 

Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw 
from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your 
declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you 
to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves 
you with just enough XP to  keep your level. 

Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 

gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at 
your feet. 

Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by  ld4 + 1 

(to a minimum score of 1). You  can draw one additional 
card beyond your declared draws. 

jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two 

additional cards beyond your declared draws. 

Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you 

are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses 
the weapon. 

Knight. You  gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who 
appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The 
fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally 
until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to 
you. You control this character. 

Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish 

spell 1d3 times. 

Rogue. A nonplayer character of the DM's choice 

becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new 
enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else 
reveals it.  Nothing less than a wish spell or divine 
intervention can end the NPC's  hostility toward you. 

Ruin. All  forms of wealth that you carry or own, 

other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable 
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you 
own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any 
documentation that proves you should own something 
lost to this card also disappears. 

Skull. You  summon an avatar of death-a ghostly 
humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and 
carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of 
the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks yo~, 
warning all others that you must win the battle alone. 
The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, 
whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, 
the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature 
slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. 

Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The 

score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. 

Sun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which 

the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

knowledge comes with wisdom on how to  apply it. 

The Void.  This black card spells disaster. Your soul 

is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a 
place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings 
guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, 
your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore 
your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object 
that holds it. You  draw no more cards.

DRIFTGLOBE 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you

used, the daylight effect can't be used again until the

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, 
warrior spirits from the plane ofYsgard appear within 
60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics 
'rom the Monster Manual.  They return to Ysgard after  1 
hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the 
horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. 

Four types of horn of Valhalla  are known to exist, each 

made of a different metal. The horn's type determines 
how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as 
£he requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's 
rype or determines it randomly.

HORSESHOES  OF A  ZEPHYR 
Wondrous item, very rare 
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all 
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar 
creature, they allow the creature to move normally 
while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect 
means the cre.ature can cross or stand above nonsolid 
or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The 
creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In 
addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up 
to  12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a 
forced march. 

HORSESHOES  OF  SPEED 
Wondrous item, rare 
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four.  While all 
four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar 
creature, they increase the creature's walking speed 
by 30 feet. 

IMMOVABLE Ron 
Rod, uncommon 
This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use 
an action to press the button, which causes the rod to 
become magically fixed in place. Until you or another 
creature uses an action to push the button again, the 
rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod 
can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight 
causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use 
an action to  make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the 
fixed rod up to  10 feet on a success.

INSTRUMENT  O F  TH E  B A R DS 
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a 
bard) 
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it 
kind, superior to  an ordinary instrument in every way. 
Seven types of these instruments exist, each named 
after a legendary bard college. The following table lists 
the spells common to all instruments, as well as the 
spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that 
attempts to play the instrument without being attuned 
to  it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
take 2d4 psychic damage. 

You  can use an action to play the instrument and cast 
one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to 
cast a spell, it can't be used to  cast that spell again until 
the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability 
and spell save DC. 

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that 

causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the 
targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This 
effect applies whether you are using the instrument as 
the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge

Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of 
shape and color. 

When you use an action to toss one of these stones 

into the air,  the stone orbits your head at a distance 
of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, 
another creature must use an action to grasp or net 
the stone to separate it from you, either by making a 
successful attack roll against AC  24 or a successful DC

to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

worn while it orbits your head. 

Absorption (Very Rare). While this  pale lavender 

ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to 
cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you 
can see and targeting only you. 

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it 

burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the 
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't 
cancel it. 

Agility(Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 
2,  to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits 
your head. 

Awareness (Rare). You can't be surprised while this 

dark blue rhomboid orbits your head. 

Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score 

increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink

Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled 

lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can 
use your reaction to  cancel a spell of 8th level or lower 
cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. 

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it 

burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the

Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score 

increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled 
pink and green sphere orbits your head. 

Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus 
increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits 
your head. 

Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while 

this dusty rose prism orbits your head. 

Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points 
at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits 
your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. 
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores 

spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The 
stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. 
When found, it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells 
chosen by the DM. 

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level 

into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The 
s pell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. 
If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended 
without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell 
determines how much space it uses. 

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any 

spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save 
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the 
original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the

IRON  BANDS  OF BILARRO 
Wondrous item, rare 
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter 
and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak 
the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or 
smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As 
the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle 
of metal bands. 

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal 
to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. 
On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus 
action to speak the command word again to release it. 
Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands 
to contract and become a sphere once more. 

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an 

action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the 
iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed , and 
the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any 
further attempts made by that creature automatically 
fail until 24 hours have elapsed. 

Once the bands are used , they can't be used again 

until the next dawn.

!RON  FLASK 

IRON  FLASK 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an 
action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a 
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the 
target is native to  a plane of existence other than the one 
you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has 
been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the 
saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the 
flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature 
at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to 
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age. 

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper 

and release the creature the flask contains. The creature 
is friendly to you and your companions for  1 hour and 
obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no 
commands or give it a command that is likely to result 
in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no 
actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in 
accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. 

An identify spell  reveals that a creature is inside 
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of 
creature is to  open the flask. A newly discovered bottle 
might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or 
determined randomly.

jAV ELIN  OF  LIGHTNING 
Weapon (javelin), uncommon 
This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and 
speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of 
lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out 
from you to a target within 120 feet.  Each creature in 
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on 
a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful 
one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when 
it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack 
against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage 
from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage. 

The javelin's property can't be used again until the 

next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used 
as a magic weapon.

Wondrous item, uncommon 
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint 
of o'il, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim 
light for an additional 30 feet.  Invisible creatures and

MACE  OF DISRUPTION 
Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)

M ARINER's ARMOR 
Armor (light,  medium, or heavy), uncommon 
While wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed

start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor 
causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor 
is decorated with fish  and shell motifs. 

M EDALLION  OF THOUGHTS 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can

M IRROR OF  LIFE TRAPPING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its 
surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror 
weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC  11, 10 hit points, and 
vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is 
destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. 

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you 
are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its 
command word and activate it. It remains activated until 
you use an action to speak the command word again. 
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection 
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must 
succeed on a DC  15 Charisma saving throw or be 
trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in 
one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This 
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature 
knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on 
the saving throw automatically. 

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled 

with thick fog  that reduces visibility to  10 feet. Creatures 
trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't 
need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within 
a cell can escape using magic that permits planar 
travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell 
until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve 

extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror 
frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate

unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing 
away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures 
it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied 
spaces near it. 

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an 

action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or 
call out a particular cell by number. The creature named 
or contained in the named cell appears as an image 
on the mirror's surface. You  and the creature can then 
communicate normally. 

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a

MITHRAL ARMOR

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt

Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the 

type of each bead on the necklace or determines it 
randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of 
the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the 
necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast 
from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a

Weapon (any sword),  very rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2  bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical 
hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, 
it must succeed on a DC  15 Constitution saving throw or 
be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its 
body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword 
loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword 
has no charges remaining, it loses this property. 

NOLZUR'S  MARVELOUS  PIGMENTS 
Wondrous item, very rare 
Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box 
with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments 
allow you to  create three-dimensional objects by 
painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from 
the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate 
on its image. 

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square 

feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects 
or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, 
cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to  10,000 cubic 
feet.  It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. 

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain 

feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. 
Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door 
that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit 
on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against 
the total area of objects you create. 

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value 

greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value 

(such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks 
authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from 
paste, bone, or some other worthless material. 

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, 

the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you 
complete the painting, doing no harm to  anything. 

0ATHBOW 
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) 
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in 
Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use 
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a 
command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have 
wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your 
sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. 
You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. 
When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new 
one after the next dawn. 

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon 

against your sworn enemy, you  have advantage on the 
roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, 
other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage 
due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy 
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. 

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage 

on attack rolls with all other weapons.

OIL OF  SHARPNESS 
Potion,  very rare 
This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin 
silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing 
weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing

container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can 
cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the 
equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional 
vial is required for each size category above Medium). 
Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature 
then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell 
for 8 hours. 

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as 
an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating 
the effect of the grease spell in  that area for 8 hours. 

PEARL OF  PowER 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
spellcaster) 
You can use an action to speak this pearl's command 
word and regain one expended spell slot of up to 3rd 
level. Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used 
again until the next dawn. 

PERIAPT OF HEALTH

wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a 
disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you 
while you wear the pendant. 

PERIAPT OF PROOF AGAINST POISON

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem 
pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on 
you. You are immune to  the poisoned condition and ha\"e 
immunity to poison damage. 

PERIAPT OF WOUND  CLOSURE 
Wondrous item,· uncommon (requires attunement)

PiPES  OF  THE  SEWERS 

PIPES  OF HAUNTING 
Wondrous item,  uncommon 
You  must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action 
to play them and expend 1 charge to  create an eerie, 
spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you 
that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw or become frightened of you for  1 minute. 
If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile 
toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw 
is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The 
pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. 

PIPES  OF THE  SEWERS 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
You  must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary 
rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will 
not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. 

The pipes have 3 charges. If you  play the pipes as 
an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 
3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the 
Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended 
charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile 
of you  to  be called in this fashion (as determined by 
the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, 
the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the 
music by the shortest available route but aren't under 
your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. 

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another 

creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you 
are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check 
contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose 
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would 
and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 
24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed 
by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and 
your companions for as long as you continue to play the 
pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys 
your commands. If you issue no commands to  a friendly 
swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. 
If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the 
pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and 
the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be 
swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. 

PLATE ARMOR OF ETHEREALNESS 
Armor (plate),  legendary (requires attunement) 
While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its 
command word as an action to gain the effect of the 
etherealness spell, which last for  10 minutes or until 
you remove the armor or use an action to speak the 
command word again. This property of the armor can't 
be used again until the next dawn. 

PORTABLE  HOLE 
Wondrous item, rare 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular 
sheet 6 feet in diameter. 

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and 
place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the 
portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 
feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

on a different plane, so it can't be u  ed to create open 
passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can 
exit the hole by climbing out of it. 

You can use an action to  close a portable hole by 

taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. 
Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or 
objects within remain in the extradimensional space.  o 
matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to  nothing. 

If the hole is folded up, a creature with in  the hole's 

extradimensional space can use an action to make 
a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the 
creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of 
the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing 
creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up 
to  10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. 
Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional 

space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy 
haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items 
and opens a gate to  the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. 
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't 
be reopened. 

POTION  OF ANIMAL FRIENDSHIP 
Potion,  uncommon 
When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal 
friendship spell (save DC 13) for  1 hour at will. Agitating

a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.

silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. 
Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors. 

POTION OF  DIMINUTION 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" 
effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for  1d4 hours (no 
concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid 
continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands 
to color the clear liquid around it.  Shaking the bottle 
fails to interrupt this process. 

POTION OF FIRE BREATH 
Potion,  uncommon 
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to 
exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target 

must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 
lire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. The effect t;nds after you exhale the 
li re three times or when 1 hour has passed. 

This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the 
top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened. 

POTION  OF  FLYING 
Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed 
equal to your walking speed for  1 hour and can hover. 
If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall 
unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This 
potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and 
has cloudy white impurities drifting in it. 

POTION  OF  GASEOUS  FORM 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of 
the gaseous form  spell for  1 hour (no concentration 
required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. 
This potion's container seems to  hold fog that moves 
and pours like water. 

POTION  OF  GIANT STRENGTH 
Potion, rarity varies 
When you drink this potion, your Strength score 
changes for  1 hour. The type of giant determines the 
score (see the table below). The potion has no effect 
on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than 
that score. 

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a 

sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. 
The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone 
giant strength have the same effect.

continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear 
liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle 
fails to interrupt this process. 

POTION OF HEALING 
Potion, rarity  varies 
You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The 
number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity,  as 
shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its 
potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

POTION OF HEROISM 
Potion, rare 
For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit 
points that last for  1 hour. For the same duration, you 
are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration 
required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as 
if boiling. 

POTION OF INVISIBILITY 
Potion,  very rare 
This potion's container looks empty but feels as though

reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. 
Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, 
there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead 
age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid 
are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, 
and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. 
These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened. 

POTION OF  MIND READING 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the 
detect thoughts spell (save DC  13). The potion's dense, 
purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it. 

POTION OF POISON 
Potion, uncommon 
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of 
healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actpally 
poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell 
reveals its true nature. 

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you 
must succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw or 
be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you 
are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. 
At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage 
you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. 
The poison ends when the damage decreases to  0.

feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use 
effect. The DM chooses the kind of token or determines 
it randomly.

again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token 
disappears.

up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed 
(16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day. 
with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying),  or 1,00G

pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after 
flying its maximum distance for  a day or if it drops to 0 
hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action. 

Fan.  If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action 

to toss the token up to  10 feet in the air. The token 
disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The 
fa n floats and creates a wind strong enough to  fill  the 
sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per 
hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action. 
Swan Boat. You  can use an action to  touch the token 
to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token 
disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped 
like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled 
and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. 
You can use an action while on the boat to command it 
to  move or to  turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry 
up to  thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large 
creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a 
Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 
hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as 
an action. 

Tree. You  must be outdoors to use this token. You 
can use an action to touch it  to  an unoccupied space 
on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place 
a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree 
is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its 
branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. 

Whip. You can use an action to  throw the token to  a 

point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a 
floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus 
action to make a melee spell attack against a creature 
within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. 
On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the 

whip to fly  up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a 
creature within  10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 
hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you 
are incapacitated or die.

hit points. It then returns to its home plane. 

While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and

R oD  OF ABSORPTIO N 
Rod, very rare (requires attunement) 
While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to 
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an 
area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, 
and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in 
the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when 
it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to  50 levels 
of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod 
absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you 
are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod 
has no effect on that spell. 

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how 

many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the 
course of its existence, and how many levels of spell 
energy it currently has stored. 

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can 

convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells 
you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots 
only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell

levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell 
as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in 
the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot. 

A newly found rod has ldlO levels of spell energy 
stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb 
spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes 
nonmagical. 

Ron OF ALERTNESS 
Rod, very rare (requires attunement) 
This rod has a flanged head and the following 
properties. 

Alertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage 

on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for 
initiative. 

SpeJJs. While holding the rod, you can use an action 

to cast one of the following spells from it:  detect evil and 
good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see 
invisibility. 

Protective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft 
end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head 
sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for 
an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and 
any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1  bonus to 
AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any 
invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light. 

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 

10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull 
the rod from the ground. This property can't be used 
again until the next dawn. 

Ron oF LoRDLY MIGHT 
Rod, legendary (requires attunement) 
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic 
mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll 
made with it. The rod has properties associated with si.:_ 
different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It 
has three other properties as well, detailed below. 
Six Buttons. You  can press one of the rod's six 

buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until 
you push a different button or until you push the same 
button again, which causes the rod to revert to its 
normal form. 

If you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue 
as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's 
flanged head. 

If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds 

down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, 
transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants 
a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. 
If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds 

down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the 
rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming 
the rod into a magic spear that grants a + 3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with it. 

If you press button 4 , the rod transforms into a 
climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In 
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and 
three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal 
bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, 
forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to  4,000 pound  .

barricades, and other barriers. 

If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in 
its  normal form and indicates magnetic north. (  othing 
happens if this function of the rod is used in a location 
that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you 
knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the 
ground or your height above it. 

Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee 

attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a 
DC 17  Constitution saving throw. On a failure,  the target 
rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a 
number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. 
This property can't be used again until the next dawn. 

Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack 

using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 
17  Strength saving throw. On a failure , the target is 
paralyzed for  1 minute. The target can repeat the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on a success. This property can't be used again until the 
next dawn.

gards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or 
ur companions, or commanded to do something 

contrary to its nature, a target ceases to  be charmed 
in this way. The rod can't be used again until the 
next dawn. 

R o n  OF  SECURITY 
Rod, very rare 
While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate 
it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to  199 
other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that 
exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that 
the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely 
glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, 
fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. 
Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough 
water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else 
that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space 
can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from 
a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside 
the extraplanar space. 

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains 

hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures 
don't age while in the paradise, although time passes 
normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 
200 days divided by the number of creatures present 
(round down). 

When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, 
all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when 
you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest 
that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days 
have passed. 

ROPE  OF  CLIMBING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and 
can hold up to  3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the 
rope and use an action to speak the command word, the 
rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the 
other end to  move toward a destination you choose. That 
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command 
it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its 
destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you 
tell it to stop. You  can also tell the rope to fasten itself 
securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or 
unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying. 

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 

1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope 
shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on 
checks made to climb it. 

The rope has AC  20 a nd 20 hit points. It regains 1 

hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit 
point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. 

ROPE  OF  ENTANGLEMENT 
Wondrous item, rare 
This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you 
hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its 
command word, the other end darts forward to  entangle 
a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target 
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or 
become restrai ned. 

You can release the creature by using a bonus action

The rope has AC  20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 

hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit 
point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. 

SADDLE  OF THE  CAVALIER 
Wondrous item, uncommon

dismounted against your will if you're conscious, and 
attack rolls against the mount have disadvantage. 

S CARAB  OF PROTECTION 
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) 
If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 
1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing 
its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on 
your person: 

You have advantage on saving throws against spells. 
The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw 
against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect 
originating from an undead creature, you can use 
your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed 
save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles 
into powder and is destroyed when its last charge 
is expended. 

SCIMITAR OF  SPEED 
Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one 
attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns. 

SCROLL OF PROTECTION

Each scroll of protection works against a specific type of 
creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by 
rolling on the following table. 

Creature Type

Fiends

81-00  Undead 

Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in a 
invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot(cid:173)
radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier 
prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or 
affecting anything within the cylinder. 

The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on 
you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature 
of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the 
effect ends. 

A creature can attempt to  overcome the barrier by 

using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. 
On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by 
the barrier. 

SENDING STONES 
Wondrous item,  uncommon 
Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone 
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily 
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an 
action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is the 
bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other 
stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone 
and don't cast the spell. 

Once sending is cast through the stones, they can't be 
used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a 
pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical. 

SENTINEL SHIELD

While holding this shield, you have advantage on 
initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. The 
shield is emblazoned with a symbol of an eye.

done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the 
application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness.  -
with a wish spell. 

SPELL SCROLL 
Scroll, varies 
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written  -
a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spellli 
you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spe 
without having to provide any of the spell's componen " 
Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. 

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher 

level than you can normally cast, you must make an 
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determ· 
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + 
spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears fro(cid:173)
the scroll with no other effect. 

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, 

and the scroll itself crumbles to dust. 

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 

spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as th 
scroll's  rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

SPHERE  O F  ANNIH I LATION 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the 
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a 
magical fi eld surrounding it. 

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through 
and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the 
exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage 
from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the 
sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere 
but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 
force damage. 

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. 

If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, 
you can use a n action to make a DC 25 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one 
direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 
5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet).  On a 
fa ilure, the sphere moves 10 fe et toward you. A creature 
whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 
4d10 force damage. 

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another 

creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) 
check contested by the other creature's Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control 
of the sphere and can levitate it as normal. 

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar 

portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an 
extradimensional space, such as that within a portable 
hole , the DM determines randomly what happens, using 
the following table.

see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target 
is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. 
The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving 
throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed , leaving 
no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace 
of its existence. When you expend the last charge, 
the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is 
destroyed.

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

SENTIENT MAGIC  ITEMS 
Some magic items possess sentience and personality. 
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirr· 
of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic 
used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a 
character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, 
bonds, and sometimes flaws . A sentient item might 
be a cherished ally to  its wielder or a continual thorn 
in the side. 

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of ite  -

can manifest sentience, but consumable items such a_ 
potions and scrolls are never sentient. 

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the 

DM's control. Any activated property of the item is 
under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as 
the wielder maintains a good relationship with the 
item, the wielder can access those properties normall_ (cid:173)
If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress 
its activated properties or even turn them against 
the wielder. 

CREATING SENTIENT MAGIC  ITEMS 
When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you 
create the item's persona in the same way you would 
create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. 

ABILITIES 
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores. You  can choose the item's abilities 
or determine them randomly. To determine them 
randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest r 
and totaling the rest. 

COMMUNICATION 
A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either 
by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts 
telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how · 
communicates or roll on the following table. 

Communication 

dlOO 
01-60  The item  communicates by transmitting emotion 

to the creature carrying or wielding it. 

61-90  The item  can  speak,  read, and  understand one or 

more languages. 

91-00  The item can speak,  read, and  understand one 

or more languages.  In  addition, the item can 
communicate telepathically with  any character tha 
carries or wields  it . 

SENSES 
With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can 
perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can 
choose its senses or roll on the following table. 

d4

Senses

A LIGN MENT 
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or 
nature might s uggest an alignment. If not, you can pick 
an alignment or roll on the following table.

Alignment

CHARACTERI STICS 
Use the information on creating NPCs in chapter 4 
to  develop a sentient item's mannerisms, personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the 
"Special Features" section earlier in  this chapter. 

If you determine these characteristics randomly, 
ignore or adapt any result that doesn't make sense 
for an inanimate object. You  can reroll until you get a 
result you like. 

SPECIAL P U RPOSE 
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, 
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the 
wielder's use of the item aligns with that special 
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from 
this course might cause conflict between the wielder 
and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent 
the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special 
purpose or roll on the following table.

determined to solve a mystery, learn  a secret, or 
unravel  a cryptic prophecy. 
Destiny Seeker: The  item  is  convinced that it and  its 
wielder have  key  roles to play  in  future events. 
Creator Seeker: The item  seeks its  creator and 
wants to  understand why  it was created . 

• 

CONFLICT 
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its 
personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a 
manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, 
conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item 
makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's 
Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make 
one or more of the following demands: 

The item insists on being carried or worn at all times 
The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything 
the item finds repugnant. 

•  The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's 

goals to the exclusion of all other goals. 
The item demands to be given to someone else. 

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes 

the item can do any or all of the following: 

Make it  impossible for its wielder to attune to  it. 
Suppress one or more of its activated properties. 
Attempt to  take control of its wielder. 

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its 

wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving 
throw, with a DC equal to  12 +the item's Charisma

SAM PLE  SENTIENT ITEMS 
The sentient weapons described here have storied 
histories. 

BLACKRAZOR 
Weapon (greats word), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a creature of non-lawful alignment) 
Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, 
Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with 
stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of 
cut obsidian. 

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. It has the following addition ~ 
properties. 

Devour Soul. Whenever you use it to reduce a 

creature to 0  hit points, the sword slays the creature 
devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead . . -. 
creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor 
can be restored to life only by a wish spell. 

When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you 

temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit 
point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. 
As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep 
Blackrazor in hand , you have advantage on attack roll  . 
saving throws, and ability checks. 

If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take ldlO 

necrotic damage and the target regains ldlO hit point 
If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, 
Blackrazor devours your soul.

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

Soul Hunter. While you hold  the weapon. you are 

aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 
60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead.  You also 
can't be charmed or frightened. 

Blackrazor can cast the haste spell  on you once per 

day.  It decides when to  cast the spell  and maintains 
concentration on it so that you don't have to. 

Sentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral 

weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to  a 
range of 120 feet. 

The weapon can speak, read, and understand 
Common, and can communicate with its wielder 
telepathically.  Its voice is deep and echoing. While you 
a re attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every 
language you know. 

Personality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious 

tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. 

The sword's purpose is to  consume souls. It doesn't 
care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The 
word believes that all matter and energy sprang from 
a void of negative energy and will one day return to  it. 
Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along. 
Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange 

kinship to  Wave  and Whelm, two other weapons locked 
away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three 
weapons to  be united again and wielded together in 
combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm 
and finds  Wave  tedious. 

Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If 

the sword goes three days or more without consuming 
a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the 
next sunset. 

M OONBLADE 
Weapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by 
an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment) 
Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the 
most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade.  In 
ancient times, nearly all  elven noble houses claimed one 
uch blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded 
from the world, their magic lost as family lines have 
become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their 
bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these 
weapons remain. 

A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The 
sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to  that 
person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can 
claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies 
dormant. It functions like a normallongsword until a 
worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. 

Amoonblade serves only one master at a time. The 

attu nement process requires a special ritual in the 
throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated 
to the elven gods. 

A moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as 

craven,  erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving a nd 
protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make 
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with 
disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you 
become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the 

blade. You remain attuned to  the weapon until you die or 
the weapon is destroyed. 

A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each 

master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune 
always grants a +1  bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the 
first grants the moon blade an additional property. The 
DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on 
the Moon Blade P roperties table. 

MOONBLADE  PROPERTIES

Property 
Increase the bonu s to attack a nd  damage rolls  by

minor property (see "Special  Features" earlier in 
this chapter). 

81-82  The moonblade gains the finesse  property. 
83-84  The moonblade gains the thrown  property (range 

20/60 feet). 

85-86  The moonblade functions  as a defender. 
87-90  The moon blade  scores a critical  hit on a  roll  of 19 

or 20. 

91-92  When you  hit with an attack using the moon blade, 

the attack an  extra  1d6 slashing damage. 

93-94  When you  hit  a creature of a specific  type  (such as 
dragon , fiend , or undead)  with  the moonblade, the 
target takes an  extra  1d6 dama ge of one of these 
types: acid , cold, fire,  lightning, o r thunder. 

95-96  You  can  use a  bonus action to cause the moonblade 
to flash  brightly.  Each  creature that can see you  and 
is  within  30 feet of you  must succeed on a  DC  15 
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 
1 minute . A creature can  repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns , ending the effect 
on  itself on a success. This property can't be used 
again  until you  take a short rest while attuned to 
the weapon .

97-98  The moonblade fun ctions as a ring of spell storing. 
You  can  use an  action to call  forth  an  elfshadow, 
provided that you  don't already have one serving 
you.  The elfshadow appears in  an  unoccupied 
space within  120 feet of you.  It  uses the statistics 
for  a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it 
is  neutral , immune to effects that turn  undead, 
and doesn't create new shadows.  You  control 
th is c reature, deciding how it acts and  moves . It 
remai ns  until  it  drops to 0  hit  points or you  dismiss 
it  as an action . 
The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.

Sentience. A moon blade is a sentient neutral good 

weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, 
sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

2T7 

when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. 
It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or 
dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. 
Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement 

of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, 
music, and life are all part of this purpose. 

The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to 
serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its 
ideals, its loyalty is absolute. 

If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once 

it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that 
person should wield it,  even if the owner falls short of 
elven ideals. 

WAVE 
Weapon (trident),  legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature that worships a god of the sea) 
Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this 
trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images 
of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must 
worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave 
happily accepts new converts. 

You  gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, 
the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its 
hit point maximum. 

The weapon also functions as a trident offish 

command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the 
benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and 
you can use it as a cube of force  by choosing the effect, 
instead of pressing cube sides to select it. 

Sentience. Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral 

alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, 
and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out 
to a range of 120 feet. 

The weapon communicates telepathically with its 

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It 
can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak 
with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder 
in the conversation. 

Personality. When it grows restless, Wave  has a habit 
of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred 
hymns of the sea gods. 

Wave  zealously desires to convert mortals to the 

worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the 
faithless to  death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to 
further the weapon's objectives in the world. 

The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the 

place where it was forged,  a desolate island called 
Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm 
giants there, and the giants forged  Wave  in an act of 
devotion to- or rebellion against-that god. 

Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and 
purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave  fears 
that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's 
demise. This destiny is something Wave  might not be 
able to avert. 

WHELM 
Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a dwarf) 
Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves 
and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. 

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls 

made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after 
you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop 
a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you 
remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to  have 
disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability 
checks while you can see the daytime sky. 

Thrown Weapon.  Whelm has the thrown property, 
with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 
feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using 
it,  the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or 
an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a gian(cid:173)
Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your 
hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the 
weapon lands at your feet. 

Shock Wave. You  can use an action to strike the 

ground with  Whelm and send a shock wave out from 
the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the 
ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. Once used, this property can't be used again 
until the next dawn. 

Supernatural Awareness. While you are holding 

the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or 
concealed doors within 30 feet of you.  In addition, you 
can use an action to  cast detect evil and good or locate 
object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you 
can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. 
Sentience. Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon 

with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a 
Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 

The weapon communicates telepathically with its 

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. 
Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish 
when used in combat. 

Personality.  Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants 
and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against 
all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy 
goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. 

Whelm has ties to  the dwarf clan that created it, 

variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. 
It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything 
to protect those dwarves from harm. 

The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries 

ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for 
a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His 
will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to  his evil 
purposes, even killing members of his own clan. 

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

ARTIFACTS 
An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, 
with its own origin and history. An artifact might have 
been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. 
It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that 
threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, 
and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in hi story. 

Some a rtifacts appear when they are needed most. 
For others , the  reverse is true; when discovered, the 
world trembles at the ra mifications of the find . In either 
case, introducing a n artifact into a campaign requires 
forethought.  The artifact could be an item that opposing 
s ides are hoping to  claim , or it might be something the 
adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge. 

Characters  don't typically find artifacts in the 

normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only 
appear when you want them to,  for they a re as much 
plot devices as magic items. Tracking down a nd 
recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an 
adventure. Characters must chase down rumors,

creator and the statistics of an empyrean  (see the 
Monster  Manual).  Once it obtains the artifact, the 
avatar vanishes. 

DESTROYING ARTIFACTS 
An artifact must be destroyed in some special way. 
Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. 

Each artifact has a weakness by which its creation 

can be undone. Learning this weakness might require 
extensive research or the successful completion of a 
quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be 
destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here: 

The artifact must be melted down  in the volcano, 
forge,  or crucible in which it was created. 
The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx. 
The artifact must be swallowed and digested by the 
tarrasque or some other ancient creature. 
The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god 
or an angel. 
The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special 
weapon crafted for that purpose. 
The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic 
gears of Mechanus. 
The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can 
destroy it by touch. 

SAMPLE ARTIFACTS 
The artifacts presented here have appeared in one or 
more of D&D worlds. Use them as guides when creating 
your own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit. 

AxE O F  T H E  D WARV ISH  LORDS 
Weapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement) 

eeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince 

came to believe that his people needed something to 
unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that 
would be such a symbol. 

Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than 
any dwarf had ever delved , the young prince came to 

the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of 
:\1oradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted 
four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge , 
the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With 
them , he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. 

Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the 

dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges 
and answered slights. The clans became allies, and 
they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era 
of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as 
the First King. When he became old, he passed the 
weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his 
heir.  The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many 
generations. 

Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and 

wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war 
fomented by greed for  its power and the status it 
bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for 
the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of 
chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. 

Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is 
a magic weapon that grants a +3  bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a 
belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of 
sharpness. 

Random Properties. The axe has the following 

randomly determined properties: 

2 minor beneficial properties 
1 major beneficial property

DwARviSH  LoRDS 

Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to 

the axe, you gain the following benefits: 

You have immunity to poison damage. 
The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. 
•  You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to 

blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. 
Conjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe, 

you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental 
spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't 
use this property again until the next dawn. 

Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the 

axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the 
teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination 
is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or 
arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this 
property again until 3 days have passed. 

Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non(cid:173)

dwarf that becomes attuned to  it.  Even if the attunement 
ends, the curse remains. With each passing day,  the 
creature's physical appearance and stature become 
more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like 
a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial 
traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical 
changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical 
in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can 
be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a 
greater restoration or remove curse spell. 

Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the 

axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where 
it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 
fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and 
is consumed. 

BOOK OF  EXALTED  DEEDS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment) 
The definitive treatise on all that is good in the 
multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures 
prominently in many religions. Rather than being a 
scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various 
authors filled the pages with their own vision of true 
virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. 

The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. 

As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other 
corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can 
bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts 
have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail 
to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it 
offers to  those pure of heart and firm of purpose. 

A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings,  . 
keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of 
good alignment that is attuned to the book can release 
the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, 
the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and 
studying the book to digest its contents and gain its 
benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open 
pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning 
and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read 
from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage 
ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced 
or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit 

points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash 
is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. 

Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last 

only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail  to 
perform at least one act of kindness or generosity wit 
the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil 
act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. 

Random Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds h~ 

the following random properties: 

2 minor beneficial properties 
•  2 major beneficial properties 

Increased Wisdom. After you spend the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, your 
Wisdom score increases by 2, to  a maximum of 24. Y  -
can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. 
Enlightened Magic.  Once you've  read and studied 
the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or 
paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. 

Halo. Once you've read and studied the book, you 

gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light 
in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additionallO 
feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus 
action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on 
Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with 
good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks 
made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends 
and undead within the halo's bright light make attack 
rolls against you with disadvantage. 

Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book 0: 
Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exi  .. 
in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the 
River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its 
pages and renders the book powerless for  ld100 years 

BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable 
wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's 
thrall. No  mortal was meant to know the secrets it 
contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the 
scrawled pages invites madness. 

Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book 
Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseas 
idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of 
blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna 
covered every vile topic he could, making the book a 
gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. 

Other practitioners of evil have held the book and 

added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. 
Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works 
stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or. ·(cid:173)
some cases, made notations and additions to existing 
text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. 
or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches 
that the original text can't be divined. 

Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary 

plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to 
approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever 
it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if th~ 
book rests on it long enough.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

VILE  LORE 
The  Book ofVile Darkness touches on every evil  in the 
cosmos. A character can  use the lore the book contains 
to unearth terrible secrets  no morta l should know. Among 
the contents a character might fi nd are the following, plus 
whatever else you  choose: 

Vile Apotheosis. The  book could  hold a ritual that allows a 
character to become a lich or death  knight. 
True  Names. The true  names of any number of fiends 
might be  in the book. 
Dark Magic. Several  spells of horrific evil  of the  OM's 
design and  choosing could  be  in the book. Spells  could 
impose dreadful  curses,  disfigure others,  require human 
sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain,  spread  vile 
plagues, and  so  on . 

A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours 

reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its 
benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's 
contents, provided that those modifications advance evil 
and expand the lore already contained within. 

Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book 
of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to  neutral evil. 

The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only 
as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you 
fail to perform at least one evil act within the span 
of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the 
book disappears. If you die while attuned to  the book, 
an entity of great evil claims your soul. You  can't be 
restored to life by any means while your soul remains 
imprisoned. 

Random Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has 

the following random properties: 

3 minor beneficial properties 

•  1 major beneficial property 

3 minor detrimental properties 
2 major detrimental properties 
Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the 

requisite amount of time reading and studying the 
book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to 
a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice 
decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't 
adjust your ability scores again. 

Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, you 
acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign 
of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might 
appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy 
black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or 
you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial 
features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature 
the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you 
advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to 
interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) 
checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. 

Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book 

and holding it, you can use an action to cast the 
dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). 
You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. 

Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness 

allows pages to be torn from it,  but any evil lore 
contained on those pages finds its way back into the 
book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages 
to the tome. 

If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed 

for  1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark 
corner of the multiverse. 

A creature attuned to the book for one hundred 

years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text 
that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, 
destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding 
flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the 
multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later. 

If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns 

to dust and is forever destroyed. 

EYE AND  HAND  OF VECNA 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed 
voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all 
wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a 
terrible empire. For all  his power, Vecna couldn't escape 
his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps 
to prevent his end from ever coming about. 

Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a 
ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond 
death, he became the greatest of allliches. Even 
though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna 
continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable 
and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to 
speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master 
of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of 
the Rotted Tower. 

Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the 
Spider Throne for himself,  or that the sword his lord 
made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the 
reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end 
in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. 
Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, 
grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered 
One's will in the world. 

The Eye of Vecna  and the Hand of Vecna  might 

be found together or separately. The eye looks like a 
bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a 
mummified and shriveled left extremity. 

To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye 

and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye 
grafts itself to your head and remains there until you 
die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye 
with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is 
ever removed, you die. 

To attune to the hand , you must lop off your left 

hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against 
the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and 
becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever 
removed, you die. 

Random Properties. The Eye of Vecna  and the Hand 

ofVecna each have the following random properties: 

•  1 minor beneficial property 
1 major beneficial property

Properties of the Eye. Your alignment changes tG

You  can use an action to see as if you were wearir:_,

to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to 
destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact 
reappears in one ofVecna's many hidden vaults, where 
ir waits to be rediscovered. 

O RB  OF DRAGONKIND 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans 
waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the 
world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of 
High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest 
magic, forging five  Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) 
w help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken 
o each of the five  towers, and there they were used to 
-peed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards 
u  ed the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed 
the dragons with powerful magic. 

As the Towers of High Sorcery fell  in later ages, the 

orbs were destroyed or faded into legend , and only three 
are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped 
and twisted over the centuries, so although their 
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions , they 
also allow some measure of control over dragons. 

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a 

presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from 
·. Those lacking in force of personality might find 
·  emselves enslaved to an orb. 

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in 

dia meter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in 

·ameter, and mist swi rls inside it. 
While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to 
xer into the orb's depths and speak its command 
:ord.  You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. 
n a successful  check, you control the orb for as long 
- you remain attuned to it.  On a failed check, you 
xcome charmed by the orb for as long as you remain 
..:.  uned to  it. 

EvE  AND  11AND 

OF  VECNA 

While you are charmed by the orb, you can't 

voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts 
suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you 
to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon 
essence within the orb might want many things: the 
annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the 
orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the 
worship ofTakhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or 
something else the DM decides. 

Random Properties. An Orb of Dragon kind has the 

following random properties: 

•  2 minor beneficial properties 
•  1 minor detrimental property 
1 major detrimental property 
Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 

expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, 
you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges 
to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: 
cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 
charge), death ward (2  charges), or scrying (3  charges). 

You can also use an action to cast the detect magic 

spell from the orb without using any charges. 

Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use 
an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call 
that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons 
in range feel  compelled to come to the orb as soon as 
possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such 
as Tiamat are unaffected by this call.  Dragons drawn to 
the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them 
against their will. Once you have used this property, it 
can't be used again for  1 hour. 

Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears 

fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the 
attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate 
spell  or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is 
sufficient to destroy an orb, however . 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

SwoRD OF  KAs 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and 
ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as 
his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain 
served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes 
earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword 
with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. 

For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich  but 

as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sw;rd 
urged him to supplant Vecna, .so that they could rule 
the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's 
destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought 
his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's 
sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. 

The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that 
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
it.  It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals 
an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. 

If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of 

being drawn from  its scabbard, its wielder must make a 
DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the 
wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the 
wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate 
monster spell, and the sword demands that it be 
bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's 
demand is met. 

Random Properties. The Sword of Kas has the 

following random properties: 

1 minor beneficial property 
•  1 major beneficial property 

1 minor detrimental property 
•  1 major detrimental property 

Spirit ofKas. While the sword is on your person, you 
add a dlO to your initiative at the start of every combat. 
In addition, when you use an action to attack with the 
sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus r 
your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remai(cid:173)
in effect until the start of your next turn. 

Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can 
use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 
18) from it:  call lightning, divine word, or finger of dea d: 
Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast 
that spell again from it until the next dawn. 

Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic e\ 
weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and 
a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 
range of 120 feet. 

The weapon communicates telepathically with its 

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common 
Personality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to 
Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the licb·s 
works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill 
this goal. 

The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone 

corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's 
obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a 
fixation for its wielder. 

Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both 
the Eye of Vecna  and the Hand of Vecna  can use the 
wish property of those combined artifacts to  unmake 
the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spe 
and make a Charisma check contested by the Charis 
. 
check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feer 
of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the 
contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasteC. 
If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.

Wt>.ND  OF  0RCUS 

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

WAND  OF  0RCUS 
Wand,  artifact (requires attunement) 
The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side. 
The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon 
lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and 
bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus 
allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to  time. 
When it does, it magically appears wherever its master 
senses an opportunity to achieve some fell  goal. 

Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped 

with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to 
a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically 
change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. 
Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh  rots, and vermin thrive 
in the wand's presence. 

Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the 

wand must make a DC 17  Constitution saving throw. 
On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic 
damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises 
as a zombie. 

In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can 

be wielded as a magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals 
an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. 

Random Properties. The Wand of Orcus has the 

following random properties: 

•  2 minor beneficial properties 

1 major beneficial property 
2 minor detrimental properties 
1 major detrimental property 

The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are 
suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself. 
Protection. You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while 

holding the wand. 

Spells. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you 

can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from 
it: animate dead (1  charge), blight (2  charges), circle of 
death (3  charges), finger of death (3  charges), power 
word kill (4  charges), or speak with dead (1  charge). The 
wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. 

While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower 

blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 
2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). 

Call Undead. While you are holding the wand, you 
can use an action to  conjure skeletons and zombies, 
calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit 
points among, each undead having average hit points 
(see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead 
magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in 
unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your 
commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of 
the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of 
bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property 
of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. 
While attuned to the wand , Orcus can summon any 

kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The 
undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following 
day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. 

Sentience. The Wand ofOrcus is a sentient, chaotic 

evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and 

a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 

The wand communicates telepathically with its 

wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal 
and Common. 

Personality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy 

Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The 
wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. 

In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns 

devotion to  its current user and makes grandiose 
promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as 
vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. 

Destroying the Wand.  Destroying the Wand of Orcus 
requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by 
the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to 
happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to  life(cid:173)
no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned 
the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. 

Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack 
and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the 
wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss. 

OTHER REWARDS 
As much as adventurers desire treasure, they often 
appreciate other forms of reward. This section 
presents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs, and 
other beings of power might recognize the characters' 
accomplishments, including supernatural gifts that 
give characters new capabilities; titles, lands, and other 
marks of prestige; and boons that are available only to 
adventurers who have reached 20th level. 

SUPERNATURAL GIFTS 
A supernatural gift is a special reward granted 
by a being or force of great magical power. Such 
supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and 
charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or 
a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a 
powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature 
that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a 
supernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't require 
attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, 
which can be used one or more times. 

BLESSINGS 
A character might receive a blessing from a deity for 
doing something truly momentous-an accomplishment 
that catches the attention of both gods and mortals. 
Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a 
blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he 
attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might. 

A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the 

following accomplishments: 

•  Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god 
•  Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god 
•  Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest 

An adventurer might also receive a blessing in 

advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin 
could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a 
terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague 
sweeping the land. 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE

A character should receive only a blessing that is 
useful to him or her, and some blessings come with 
expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god 
typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such 
as recovering a holy person's remains or toppling a 
tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing 
if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts 
counter to  it. 

A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or 

until it is taken away by the god who granted it.  Unlike 
a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an 
anti magic field or similar effect. 

Most adventurers go  their entire lives without 

receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit 
on the number of blessings a character can receive, 
but it should be rare for a character to  have more than 
one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from 
multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For / 
example, a character can't benefit from two instances,,s>f 
the Blessing of Health at once. 

Example blessings are provided below. The text of a 

blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more 
blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the 
properties of a wondrous item. 

Blessing of Health. Your Constitution score increases 

by 2,  up to a maximum of 22. 

Blessing of Protection. You  gain a +1  bonus to AC 

and saving throws. 

Blessing of Magic Resistance. You  have advantage on 

saving throws against spells and other magical effects. 

Blessing of Understanding. Your Wisdom score 

increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22. 

Blessing ofValhaJJa. This blessing grants you the 

power to  summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a 
silver horn of Valhalla.  Once you use this blessing, you 
can't use it again until 7 days have passed. 

Blessing of Weapon Enhancement. One nonmagical 

weapon in your possession becomes a +1  weapon 
whenever you wield it. 

Blessing of Wound Closure. This blessing grants you 

the benefits of a periapt of wound closure. 

CHARMS 
A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can 
be received in a large variety of ways. For example, 
a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead 
arch mage's spellbook might be infused with the magic 
of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's 
riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary 
creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, 
sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some 
explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm 
after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in 
primeval magic. 

Some charms can be used only once, and others can 

be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a 
charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without 
spending a spell slot or providing any components 
(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't 
be used in the area created by an antimagic field  or a 
similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to 
dispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can't be 

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

removed from a creature by anything short of divine 
intervention or the wish spell. 

Example charms are provided below. The text of a 

charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the 
effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to  create more 
charms of your own , if you like. 

Charm of Animal Conjuring. This charm allows 

you to  cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version 
as an action. Once used three times, the charm 
vanishes from you. 

Charm ofDarkvision. This charm allows you to 

cast the darkvision spell as an action, no components 
required. Once used three times, the charm goes awa_ 
Charm of Feather FaJJing. This charm grants you  -(cid:173)
benefits of a ring of feather falling.  These benefits last 
for  10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you. 
Charm of Heroism. This charm allows you to give 

yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 

Charm of Restoration. This charm has 6 charges. 
You can use an action to expend some of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells: greater restoration 
(4 charges) or Jesser restoration (2  charges). Once 
all  its charges have been expended, the charm 
vanishes from you. 

Charm of the Slayer. One sword in your possession 
becomes a dragon slayer or giant slayer (DM's choice) 
for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you 
and the weapon returns to normal. 

Charm of Vitality. This charm allows you to give 

yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 

MARKS  OF  PRESTIGE 
Sometimes the most memorable reward for  adventure~ 
is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. 
Their adventures often earn them fame and power, 
allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to 
their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as 
commoners who ventured into the dangerous places oi 
the world and made names for themselves through the -
brave deeds. 

This section details the most common marks of 

prestige that adventures might acquire during a 
campaign. These marks are usually gained along with 
treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own. 

LETTERS  OF RECOMMENDATION 
When gold is in short supply, the adventurers' 
benefactor might provide them with a letter of 
recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a 
letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio,  case, or 
scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the 
signature and seal of whoever wrote it. 

A letter of recommendation from a person of 

impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access 
to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble 
meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. 
Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's 
person can help clear up "misunderstandings" with 
local authorities who might not otherwise take the 
adventurers at their word . 

A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as 
the person who wrote it and offer  no benefit  in places 
where its writer holds no sway. 

MEDALS 
Although they are often fash ioned from gold  and 
other precious materials, medals have an even greater 
symbolic value to those who award and receive them. 
Medals are typically awarded by powerful political 

figures for acts of heroism, a nd wearing a medal 
is usually enough to  earn the respect of those who 
understand its significance. 

Different acts of heroism can warrant different 

kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron 
campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor 
(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) 
to adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while 
the Golden Bear of Breland (a  medal made of gold and 
shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for 
eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their 
allegiance to  the Brelish Crown by uncovering and 
defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and 
reignite the Last War. 

A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to  one 
who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For 
example, a character who proudly displays the Golden 
Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people 
within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the 
medal carries far less weight, except among allies of 
Breland's  king. 

PARCELS  OF  LAND 
A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a 
royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a 
reward for some service. Such land usually remains the 
property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased 
to  a character with the understanding that it can be 
taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called 
into question. 

A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or 

more farms or villages on it already, in which case the 
recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is 
expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties. 
A character who receives a parcel of land is free to 

build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may 
yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell 
or trade it without permission from the local ruler or 
ruling body. 

Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers 

who are looking for a place to settle or who have family 
or some kind of personal investment in the region where 
the land is located. 

SPECIAL FAVORS 
A reward might come in the form of a favor that the 
characters can call on at some future date. Special 
favors work best when the individual granting them is 
trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will 
do whatever can be done to fulfill  an obligation when 
the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil 
NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. 
A neutral good or neutral  PC might pay off favors to 
protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is 

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

more·concerned about doing right by the adventurers, 
honoring any obligations without worrying too much 
about personal risk or adherence to  the law. 

SPECIAL RIGHTS 
A politically powerful person can reward characters by 
giving them special rights, which are usually articulated 
in some sort of official document. For example, 
characters might be granted special rights  to  carry 
weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or 
negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right 
to demand free room and board from any establishment 
within a particular community, or have the right to draft 
local militia to assist them as needed. 

Special rights last only as long as the legal document 

dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the 
adventurers abuse them. 

STRONGHOLDS 
A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned 
adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a" 
powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, 
a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold 
can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of 
a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While 
the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they 
see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of 
the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove 
disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or 
forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold. 

As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing 
the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost 
for a period of one or more months, after which the 
characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for 
more information on stronghold maintenance. 

TITLES 
A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense 
titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see 
above). For example, a character might be awarded the 
title Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along 
with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region 
of the same name. 

A character can hold more than one title, and in a 
feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or 
distributed among) one's children. While a character 
holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner 
befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away 
if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question 
the character's loyalty or competence. 

ALTERNATIVES  TO  EPIC  BOONS 
You  might decide to grant one of the following  rewards to a 
20th-level character,  instead of awarding an  epic boon. These 
two options can  be awarded to a character more than once. 
Ability Score  Improvement. The character can increase one 

ability score by  2 or increase two ability scores by  l  each. 
The ability score can  now be increased above 20, up to a 
maximum of 30. 

New Feat. The character gains a  new feat chosen by the 

player, but subject to your approval.

CHAPTER 7  I TREASURE 

TRAINING 
A character might be offered  pecial training in lieu of 
a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely 
available and thus is highly desirable. It presu mes 
the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired 
adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a 
mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or 
haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor,  the 
knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of 
a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a 
remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain , a 
warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an 
absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known 
throughout the land. 

A character who agrees to training as a reward must 

spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for 
more information on downtime activities). In exchange, 
the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. 
Possible training benefits include the following: 

The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 
ld4 + 6 days. 

•  The character gains proficiency in a skill. 

The character gains a feat. 

EPIC  BOONS 
An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th 
level characters. Characters at that level gain such 
boons only if you want them to and only when you feel 
it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after 
the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish 
something else particularly notable. A character might 
gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, 
defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion 
from the Outer Planes. 

Epic boons can also be used as a form of 

advancement, a way to provide greater power to 
characters who have no more levels to gain. With this 
approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each 
character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 
355,000 XP. 

You determine which epic boon a character gains. 
Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character 
would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a 
player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to 
your approval. 

Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its 

place in your story and world. Many of the boons are 
extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation 
of a character into something resembling a demigod. 
The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a 
character. For example, the eyes of a character with 
the Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels 
strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of 
High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering 
around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first 
appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and 
mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest 
to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an 
exciting scene in an adventure. 

The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon 

says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.

CHAPTER  7  I TREASURE 

CHAPTER 8:  RUNNING THE  GAME 

ULES ENABLE YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO HAV E 
fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice 
versa. There are the rules of the game, and 
there are table rules for how the game is 
played. For instance, players need to  know 
what happens when one of them misses a 
session. They need to know whether to bring 
m iniatures, any special rules you've  decided to use, and 
how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its 
face can't be clearly read). These topics and more are 
covered in this chapter. 

TABLE  RULES 
Ideally, players come to  the gaming table with the same 
goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives 
recommendations for table rules you can establish to 
help  meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals: 
Foster respect. Don't bring personal conflicts to  the 

table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. 
Don't touch others' dice if they're sensitive about it. 
Avoid distractions. Turn off the television and video 

games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. 
Reducing distractions helps players stay in character 
and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players 
wandering away from the table and back, but some 
players prefer planned breaks. 

Have snacks. Decide before a session who will bring 
food  and drink. This is often something the players 
can handle. 

TABLE TALK 
Set expectations about how players talk at the table: 

Make it clear who's speaking: the character or the 
player (out of character). 
Decide how you feel about a player sharing 
information that his or her character wouldn't know or 
that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of 
being unconscious, dead, or far away. 
Are you all right with players retracting what they just 
said their characters did? 

DICE  ROLLING 
Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full 
view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a 
player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone 
else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive. 
When a die falls on the floor,  do you count it or reroll 
it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the 
book away and see where it lands, or re~;oll it? 

What about you,  the DM? Do you make your rolls in 
the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider 
the following: 

If you roll dice where the players can see, they know 
you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls. 
Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing 
about the strength of their opposition. When a 

monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level 
than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers? 
Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if 
you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a 
character, you could change the second critical hit 
into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don't distort die rolls 
too often, though , and don't let on that you're doing it. 
Otherwise, your players might think they don't face 
any real risks-or worse, that you're playing favorites. 
A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For 
example, if a player thinks there might be someone 
invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (Perception) 
check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if 
no one is there, making the player think someone is, 
indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick. 
You  might choose to make a roll for a player because 
you don't want the player to know how good the check 
total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness 
might be charmed and wants to  make a Wisdom 
(Insight) check, you could make the roll in secret for 
the player. If the player rolled and got a high number 
but didn't sense anything amiss, the player would be 
confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a 
low roll, a negative answer wouldn't mean much. A 
hidden roll allows uncertainty. 

ROLLING ATTACKS  AND  DAMAGE 
Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first 
and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and 
damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little 
faster around the table. 

RULES  DISCUSSIONS 
You  might need to set a policy on rules discussions at 
the table. Some groups don't mind putting the game 
on hold while they hash out different interpretations 
of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and 
continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue 
in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a 
player) and return to the issue later. 

METAGAME THINKING 
Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as 
a game.  It's like when a character in a movie knows it's a 
movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might 
say, "The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful monster 
at us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a 
lot of time describing that door- let's search it again!" 
Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a 

gentle reminder: "What do your characters think?" You 
can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations 
that will be difficult for the characters and that might 
require negotiation or retreat to survive. 

MISSING PLAYERS 
How should you deal with the characters of missing 
players? Consider these options: 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNN lNG THE  GAME 

Have another player run the missing player's 
character. The player running the extra character 
should strive to keep the character alive and use 
resources wisely. 

•  Run the character yourself. It's an extra burden for 

you, but it can work. 

•  Decide the character isn't there. Invent a good reason 

for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps 
by having him or her linger in town or continue a 
downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to 
rejoin the party when the player returns. 
Have the character fade into the background. This 
solution requires everyone to step out of the game 
world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the 
easiest solution. You  act as if the character's not there, 
but don't try to come up with any in-game explanation 
for  this absence. Monsters don't attack the character, 
who returns the favor.  On returning, the player 
resumes playing as if he or she was never gone. 

SMALL GROUPS 
Most of the time, each player runs one character. 
The game plays best that way, without overwhelming 
anyone. But if your group is small, players can control 
more than one character. Or you can fill  out the group 
with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, 
"Creating Nonplayer Characters." You can also make 
the characters more resilient by using the healing surge 
option in chapter 9,  "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 

Don't force a reluctant player to  take on multiple 

characters, and don't show favoritism by allowing only 
one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of 
the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one 
character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly 
talking to themselves in character, or avoiding 
roleplaying altogether. 

Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game 

that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character 
death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each 
player keep one or two additional characters on hand, 
ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. 
Each time the main character gains a level, the backup 
characters do as well. 
NEW PLAYERS ------
When a new player joins the group, allow the new 
player to create a character of a level equal to the 
lowest-level member of the party. The only exception 
to this guideline is when the new player is completely 
unfamiliar with the D&D game. In that case, have that 
player start with a  1st-level character. If the rest of tlie 
party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a 
short break from the campaign and having everyone 
play a  1st-level character for a few sessions while the 
new player learns the ropes. 

Integrating a new character into the group can be 

difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The 
following approaches can help make it easier: 

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE. GAME 

The new character is a friend or relative of one of the 
adventurers who has been searching for the group. 

•  The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other 
characters are fighting. When rescued, this character 
joins their group. 
The new character is the sole survivor of another 
adventuring group. 

THE ROLE  OF  DICE 
Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the 
outcome of an action without assigning any motivation 
to the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to 
which you use them is entirely up to you. 

ROLLING WITH  IT 
Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. Whe 
a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check a 
picks a DC. As a DM  using this style, you can't rely on 
the characters succeeding or failing on any one check 
to  move the action in a specific direction. You must be 
ready to improvise and react to a changing situation. 

Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that 
anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that 
the party's hal fling can leap on the ogre's  back, pull a 
sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a 
lucky enough roll it just might work. 

A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying 

can diminish if players feel  that their die rolls, rather 
than their decisions and characterizations, always 
determine success. 

IGNORING THE  DICE 
One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some 
DMs use them only during combat, and determine 
success or failure as they like in other situations. 

With this approach, the DM decides whether an action 
or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the player: 
make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or 
other factors. For example, the players might describe 
how they search for a secret door, detailing how they 
tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find  its trigger. 
That could be enough to convince the DM that they 
find  the secret door without having to  make an ability 
check to  do so. 

This approach rewards creativity by encouraging 

players to look to the situation you've described for an 
answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or 
their character's special abilities. A downside is that no 
DM is completely neutral. ADM might come to favor 
certain players or approaches, or even work against 
good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she 
doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game if the 
DM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters 
must describe to overcome an obstacle. 

THE MIDDLE  PATH 
Many DMs find  that using a combination of the two 
approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice 
against deciding on success, you can encourage your 
players to strike a balance between relying on their 

bonuses and abilities and paying attention 
to the ga me and immersing themselves in 
its world. 

Remember that dice don't run your 

game- you do. Dice are like rules. They're 
tools to  help keep the action moving. At any 
time, you can decide that a player's action is 
automatically successful. You can also grant 
the player advantage on any ability check, 
reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the 
character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan 
or unfortunate circumstances can transform the 
easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose 
disadvantage. 

USING ABILITY SCORES 
When a player wants to do something, it's often 
appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll 
or a reference to the character's ability scores. For 
example, a character doesn't normally need to make 
a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a 
Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a 
roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure. 

When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two 

questions: 

Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that 
there should be no chance of failure? 
Is a task so inappropriate or impossible- such as 
hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work? 

If the answer to  both of these questions is no, some kind 
of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide 
guidance on determining whether to call for an ability 
check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; 
when to  use advantage and disadvantage; and other 
related topics. 

ABILITY CHECKS 
An ability check is a test to see whether a character 
succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. 
The Player's Handbook includes examples of what 
each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table 
summarizes that material for easy reference. 

MULTIPLE ABILITY CHECKS 
Sometimes a character fails an ability check and 
wants to  try again. In some cases, a character is free 
to  do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With 
enough attempts and enough time, a character should 

~ ABILITY CHECKS 

• 

eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, 
assume that a character spending ten times the normal 
amount of time needed to complete a task automatically 
succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating 
the check allows a character to turn an impossible task 
into a successful one. 

In other cases, failing an ability check makes it 

impossible to  make the same check to do the same thing 
again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town 
guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover 
agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of 
Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom 
(Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The 
characters can come up with a different way to get past 
the guard or try the check again against another guard 
at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial 
failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.

CONTESTS 
A contest is a kind of ability check that matches 
two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a 
character attempts something that either directly foils 
or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a 
contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, 
rather than to a target number. 

When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that 

each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the 
same ability or whether different abilities should counter 
each other. For example, when a creature tries to  hide, it 
engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if 
two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding 
a door closed against another's attempt to push it open, 
both use Strength. 

ATTACK ROLLS 
-----

------------

Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a 
creature or an object with an attack, especially when 
the attack could be foiled  by the target's armor or shield 
or by another object providing cover. You can also use 
attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as 
archery contests or a game of darts. 

SAVING THROWS 
A saving throw is an instant response to  a harmful effect 
and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the 
most sense when something bad happens to a character 
and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An 
ability check is something a character actively attempts 
to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second 
response to the activity of someone or something else. 

Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when 
an effect-such as a spell, monster ability, or trap-calls 
for it,  telling you what kind of saving throw is involved 
and providing a DC for it. 

Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a 
saving throw, especially when a character is subjected 
to a harmful effect that can't be hedged out by armor or 
a shield. It's up to you to decide which ability score is 
involved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions. 

INTELLIGENCE CHECK  VS.  WISDOM  CHECK 
If you  have trouble deciding whether to call  for  an  Intelli(cid:173)
gence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character 
notices something, think of it  in  terms of what a very  high  or 
low  score in  those two  abilities  might mean. 

A character with  a high Wisdom  but low  Intelli gence  is 
aware of the surroundings but is  bad  at interpreting what 
things  mean. The character might spot that one section  of 
a wall  is  clean  and dusty compared to the others, but he or 
she wouldn't necessarily make the deduction that a secret 
door is there. 

In  contrast, a character with  high  Intelligence and  low 

Wisdom  is  probably oblivious  but clever. The character might 
not spot the clean  section of wall  but,  if asked about it,  could 
immediately deduce why  it's  clean. 

Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is 
around them  (the wall  is  clean  here), while  Intelligence 
checks answer why things are that way  (there's  probably a 
secret door).

DIFFICULTY CLASS 
It's your job to  establish the Difficulty Class for an abi li  _ 
check or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure 
doesn't give you one. Sometimes you'll even want to 
change such established DCs. When you do so, think o: 
how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC 
from the Typical DCs table. 

TYPICAL  DCs

DC 
5 
10 
15 

Task 
Hard 
Very  hard 
Nearly impossible 

DC 
20 
25 
30 

The numbers associated with these categories of 
difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, 
so that you don't have to  refer to this book every time 
you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC 
categories at.the gaming table. 

If you've decided that an ability check is called for, 

then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy 
one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with 
little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are 
unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without 
making a check. 

Then ask yourself, "Is this task's difficulty easy, 

moderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use are 1C 
15, and 20, your game will run just fine.  Keep in mind 
that a character with a  10 in the associated ability and 
no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 
percent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher 
score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task 
typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d2 0 
also doesn't hurt. 

If you find yourself thinking, "This task is especially 
hard," you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution 
and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task 
is very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, bu(cid:173)
it becomes more reasonable after lOth level or so. A 
DC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level 
characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and -
relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the 
die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty. 

VARIANT:  AUTOMATIC  SUCCESS 
Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll  leads to 
ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a successful 
DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter 
with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the 
door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with 
a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from 
its hinges. 

If such results bother you, consider allowing 

automatic success on certain checks. Under this 
optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any 
ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant 
ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the 
fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule 
doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls. 

Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also 

grant automatic success. If a character's proficiency 
bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character 
automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that 
character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if 
the DC is 15 or less. 

The downside of this whole approach is its 

predictability. For example, once a character's ability 
score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that 
ability become automatic successes. Smart players 
will then always match the character with the highest 
ability score against any given check. If you want some 
risk of failure, you need to  set higher DCs. Doing this, 
though, can aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: 
higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even 
more on luck. 

PROFICIENCY 
When you ask a player to  make an ability check, 
consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply 
to it. The player might also ask you if a particular 
proficiency applies. 

One way to think about this question is to consider 

whether a character could become better at a particular 
task through training and practice. If the answer is 
no, it's fine  to  say that no proficiency applies. But if 
the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool 
proficiency to reflect that training and practice. 

SKILLS 
As described in the Player's Handbook, a skill 
proficiency represents a character's focus on one 
aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's 
Dexterity score describes, the character might be 
particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in 
proficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used 
for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity. 

Under certain circumstances, you can decide a 

character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to  a 
different ability check. For example, you might decide 
that a character forced to swim from an island to the 
mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as 
opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance 
involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics 
skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the 
character's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability 

check. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution 
(Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 

Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill 

proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide 
a good justification for why a character's training and 
aptitude in a skill should apply to  the check, go ahead 
and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking. 

TOOLS 
Having proficiency with a tool allows you to  apply 
your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make 
using that tool. For example, a character proficient 
with carpenter's tools can apply his or her proficiency 
bon.us to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute,  an 
Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a 
Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However, 
the proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check 
made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to 
discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check 
requires tool  use. 

SAVING THROWS AND ATTACK ROLLS 
Characters are either proficient with a saving throw 
or attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a 
character is proficient. 

ADVANTAGE AND  DISADVANTAGE 
Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful 
tools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary 
circumstances that might affect the chances of a 
character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage 
is also a great way to reward a player who shows 
exceptional creativity in play. 

Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage 

through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or 
other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other 
cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a 
roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage 
or impose disadvantage as a result. 

Consider granting advantage when  000 

Circumstances not related to  a creature's inherent 
capabilities provide it with an edge. 
Some aspect of the environment contributes to the 
character's chance of success. 

•  A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in 

attempting or describing a task. 

•  Previous actions (whether taken by the character 

making the attempt or some other creature) improve 
the chances of success. 
Consider imposing disadvantage when  000 

•  Circumstances hinder success in some way. 
•  Some aspect of the environment makes success less 
likely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a 
penalty to the roll being made). 

•  An  element of the plan or description of an action 

makes success less likely. 

Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each 
other out, there's no need to keep track of how many 
circumstances weigh on both sides. 

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME 

For example, imagine a wizard is running down a 
dungeon cor~idor to escape from a beholder. Around 
the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard 
hear the ogres readying their ambush? You  look at 
the wizard's passive Wisdom (Perception) score and 
consider all the factors weighing on it. 

The wizard is running, not paying attention to what's 

ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the 
wizard's ability check. However, the ogres are readying 
a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, 
which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. 
As a result, the character has neither advantage nor 
disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need 
to  consider any additional factors.  Past encounters with 
an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are 
still ringing from  the thunderwave spell he cast at the 
beholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon- none of 
that matters any more. They all cancel out. 

INSPIRATION 

Awarding inspiration is an effective way to  encourage 
roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's 
Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an 
obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one 
ability check, attack roll , or saving throw. Remember 
that a character can have no more than one inspiration 
at a time. 

AWARDING INSPIRATION 
Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to 
enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using 
inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of 
the game. If you take away anything from this section, 
remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the 
game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration 
when players take actions that make the game more 
exciting, amusing, or memorable. 

As a rule of thumb, aim to  award inspiration to each 

character about once per session of play.  Over time, you 
might want to  award inspiration more or less often, at 
a rate that works best for your table. You  might use the 
same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might 
change it with each campaign. 

Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain 

types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as 
a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make 
the game more fun for your group? What type of action 
fit  in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer 
to those questions help determine when you award 
inspiration. 

Roleplaying. Using inspiration to reward roleplaying 

is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a 
player with inspiration when that player causes his or 
her character to do something that is consistent with 
the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The 
character's action should be notable in some way. It 
might drive the story forward , push the adventurers into 
danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. 
you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that 
makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else. 

Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and 

try not to  favor one style over another. For example, 
Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and 
adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels 
self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe 
his character~s attitude and actions. Neither style is 
better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to 
take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly 
makes the game better for everyone. 

Heroism. You can use inspiration to encourage 
player characters to take risks. A fighter might not 
normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid 
of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the 
character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a 
reward tells the players that you want them to embrace 
swashbuckling action. 

This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize 

action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider 
allowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather 
than before. This approach turns inspiration into a 
cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes 
into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. 
Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting. 
A Reward for Victory. Some DMs prefer to play an 

impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally 
requires a DM's judgment to  award, which might 
run against your style if you like a campaign where 
you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your 

s tyle, consider using inspiration as a reward when 
the characters achieve an important goal or victory, 
representing a surge of confidence and energy. 
Under this model, give everyone in the party 
inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a 
powerful foe , execute a cunning plan to achieve a 
goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in 
the campaign. 

Genre Emulation. Inspiration is a handy tool for 

reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. 
Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as 
personality traits, flaws , and bonds that can apply to  any 
of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired 
by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: 
"I can't resist helping a person I find alluring despite 
warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble." If the 
characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive 
noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue 
and betrayal, reward them with inspiration. 

Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't 

help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its 
secrets. They probably also go off alone when they 
shouldn't. If the party splits up, consid~r giving each 
character inspiration. 

A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues 

and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, 
we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing 
with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this 
approach to work, create a list of your genre's main 
conventions and share it with your players. Before the 
campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your 
group is on board for embracing those conventions. 
Players and Inspiration. Remember that a player 
with inspiration can award it to another player. Some 
groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, 
deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's 
best to let players award their inspiration as they see 
fit,  but feel free to talk to them about following certain 
guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce 
conventions of a certain genre. 

W HEN Do You AwARD  INSPIRATION? 
Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some 
DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. 
Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering 
inspiration while a player is considering options. Both 
approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. 

Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of 

play, but it also means players don't know whether their 
decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the 
player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned 
it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it 
or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This 
approach works best for groups that want to focus on 
im mersion and player agency, where the DM steps 
back and gives the players more freedom to do what 
they want. 

Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration 

provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are 

manipulating the players or making choices for them. 
Offering inspiration before an action works great with 
groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre 
emulation and group storytelling, where character 
freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling 
tale together. 

Start with awarding inspiration after an action , 

especially for your first campaign or when playing with 
a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the 
flow of play and avoids making the players feel  as if you 
are being manipulative. 

TRACKING INSPIRATION 
A player typically notes on a character sheet whether 
he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or 
some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special 
d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends 
inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it 
back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to 
someone else, the d20 can go to that other person. 

IGNORING INSPIRATION 
Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some 
DMs feel  it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and 
others feel  that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts 
of the game are their own rewards that don't need 
incentives like inspiration. 

If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the 

players that your campaign is one where you let the 
dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty 
campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an 
impartial role as a rules arbiter. 

VARIANT :  ONLY PLAYERS AWARD  INSPIRATION 
As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. 
Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget 
to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players 
to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every 
session, each player can award inspiration to another 
player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group 
has agreed on for awarding inspiration. 

This approach makes your life easier and also gives 

players the chance to recognize each other for good 
play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being 
awarded fairly. 

This approach works best with groups that are 

focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely 
manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, 
without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying 
or whatever other criteria the group has established. 
In this variant, you can allow each player to award 

inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the 
first time that a player awards inspiration in a session 
is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same 
es  ion. you gain inspiration that you can spend to give 
advantage to  any foe of the player characters. There's 
no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in 
this way. and unspent inspiration carries over from one 
session to the next. 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING THE  GAME 

RESOLUTION AND  CONSEQUENCES 
You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability 
checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is 
straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage. 
When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature 
suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or 
exceeds the DC, the check succeeds. 

As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and 

approaches you can take when adjudicating success and 
failure to make things a little less black-and-white. 

SuccEss AT A  CosT 
Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded 
when a character fails by the barest margin. When a 
character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the 
character to succeed at the cost of a complication or 
hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the 
following lines: 

A character manages to get her sword past a 
hobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, 
but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her. 
A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a 
fireball but ends up prone. 
A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but 
the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking 
at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters. 
•  A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the 

top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the 
rope on which his companions dangle below him is 
close to breaking. 

When you introduce costs such as these, try to make 

them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature 
of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, 
players must consider new ways of facing the challenge. 

You can also use this technique when a character 

succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, 
complicating marginal success in interesting ways. 

DEGREES  OF  FAILURE 
Sometimes a failed ability check has different 
consequences depending on the degree of failure. For 
example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest 
might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 
5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap 
wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt. 
Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. 
Perhaps a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check means a 
queen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means 
she throws you ir the dungeon for your impudence. 

CRITICAL SUCCESS  OR FAILURE 
Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw 
doesn't normally have any special effect. However, 
you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into 
account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you 
to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy 
approach is to increase the impact of the success or 
failure. For example, rolling a  1 on a failed attempt 
to pick a lock might break the thieves' tools being 
used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue. 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING THE  GAME

EXPLORATION 
This section provides guidance for running exploration, 
especially travel, tracking, and visibility. 

USING A  MAP 
Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, 
you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate 
the details of their travels. In a dungeon , tracking 
movement on a map lets you describe the branching 
passages, doors, chambers, and other features the 
adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players 
the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a 
wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and 
other features that might guide the characters on their 
travels- or lead them astray. 

The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on 

maps of different scales. The table shows how much 
distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot 
in  minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel 
paces- slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's 
Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can 
walk about 24 miles in a day.

SPECIAL TRAVEL PACE 
The rules ori travel pace in the Player's Handbook 
assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over 
time, is unaffected by the individual members' walking 
speeds. The difference between walking speeds can 
be significant during combat, but during an overland 
journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to 
catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower 
ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by 
another traveler's endurance. 

A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring 

through the air on a carpet of flying,  or riding a sailboar 
or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel 
at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind 
doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't 
contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a 
creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed 
granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as 
wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel 
rates using the following rules: 

In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to 
your speed times 10. 
In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to 
your speed divided by 10. 

For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by 
the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours). 
For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third. 
For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds. 

For example, a character under the effect of a wind 

walk spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet.  In 1 minute, 
the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 
4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. 
The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an 
hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character 
to  travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day. 

Similarly, a phantom steed spell creates a magical 
mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a 
real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 
1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at 
a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the 
character can travel 7,  10, or 13 miles. 

VISIBILITY OUTDOORS 
When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 
miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point 
where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. 

Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, 
and fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet. 

On a clear day,  the characters can see 40 miles if they 

are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able 
to look down on the area around them from a height. 

NOTICING OTHER CREATURES 
While exploring, characters might encounter other 
creatures. An important question in such a situation is 
who notices whom. 

Indoors, whether the sides can see one another 
usually depends on the configuration of rooms and 
passageways. Vision might also be limited by light 
sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, 
weather, and time of day.  Creatures can be more likely 
to hear one another before they see anything. 

If neither side is being stealthy, creatures 

automatically notice each other once they are within 
sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, 
compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the 
creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive 
Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as 
explained in the Player's Handbook. 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME 

243 

TRACKING 
Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following 
the tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might 
track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures 
must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You might 
require trackers to make a new check in any of the 
following circumstances: 

•  They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short 

or long rest. 
The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that 
shows no tracks. 

•  The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way 

that makes tracking harder. 

The DC for the check depends on how well the ground 
shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary 
in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, 
no check is needed to track an army advancing along 
a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is 
more challenging, unless the creature being tracked 
leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time 
often makes tracks harder to follow.  In a situation where 
there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is 
impossible. 

The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting 
the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on 
your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant 
advantage on the check if there's more than one set 
of tracks to  follow, or disadvantage if the trail being 
followed  passes through a well-trafficked area. 

On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can 
attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the 
area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area 
such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.

SOCIAL INTERACTION 
During a social interaction, the adventurers usually have 
a goal. They want to extract information, secure aid, 
win someone's trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, 
negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective 
led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures 
they interact with also have agendas. 

Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a 

free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come 
into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of 
an interaction by having characters make Charisma 
checks. Either approach works, and most games 
fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill 
(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill 
(reflected by ability checks). 

CHAPTER  8  I RUNNING THE  GAME 

RESOLVING  INTERACTIONS ------

The Player's Handbook provides guidelines for 
balanci ng roleplaying and ability checks in a social 
interaction (see chapter 8, "Adventuring," in that book . 
This section adds to that material by providing a 
structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of 
this structure will be invisible to your players in play aD: 
isn't meant to be a substitute for roleplaying. 

l. STARTING ATTITUDE 
Choose the starting attitude of a creature the 
adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent. 
or hostile. 

A friendly creature wants to help the adventurers 
and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions 
that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly 
creatures usually help without question. If an element 
personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check 
might be required to convince a friendly creature to take 
that risk. 

An indifferent creature might help or hinder the 
party, depending on what the creature sees as most 
beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessarily 
make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent 
creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable 
or anything in between. A successful Charisma check 
is necessary when the adventurers try to  persuade an 
indifferent creature to do something. 

A hostile creature opposes the adventurers and their 

goals but doesn't necessarily attack them on sight. 
For example, a condescending noble might wish to 
see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep 
them from becoming rivals for the king's attention, 
thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than 
direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to 
succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks 
to  convince a hostile creature to do anything on their 
behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill(cid:173)
disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can 
improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway i· 
through diplomacy fails automatically. 

2.  CONVERSATION 
Play out the conversation. Let the adventurers make 
their points, trying to frame their statements in 
terms that are meaningful to  the creature they are 
interacting with. 

Changing Attitude. The attitude of a creature 

might change over the course of a conversation. If 
the adventurers say or do the right things during 
an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature's 
ideal, bond, or flaw) , they can make a hostile creature 
temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature 
temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe,  insult, or harmful 
deed might make a friendly creature temporarily 
indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile. 
Whether the adventurers can shift a creature's 

attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurer 
have successfully couched their statements in terms 
that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature's 
attitude can't shift more than one step during a single 
interaction, whether temporarily or permanently. 

Determining Characteristics. The adventurers don't 

necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full 
understanding of a creature's ideal. bond , or flaw.  If they 
want to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these 
characteristics, they first need to determine what the 
creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs 
the risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong 
direction if they guess badly. 

After interacting with a creature long enough to get 

a sense of its personality traits and characteristics 
through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a 
Wisdom (Insight) check to uncover one of the creature's 
characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 
10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you 
should provide a false characteristic or invert one of 
the creature's existing characteristics. For example, if 
an old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the 
uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check 
might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to 
the education of the downtrodden. 

Given time, adventurers can also learn about a 

creature's characteristics from other sources, including 
its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told 
stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis 
of an entirely different set of social interactions. 

3.  CHARISMA CHECK 
When the adventurers get to the point o( their 
request, demand, or suggestion- or if you decide the 
conversation has run its course- call for a Charisma 
check. Any character who has actively participated in 
the conversation can make the check. Depending on 
how the adventurers handled the conversation, the 
Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation skill might apply 
to the check. The creature's current attitude determines 
the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown 
in the Conversation Reaction table.

Friendly Creature's Reaction 
The creature does as asked without taking risks  or 
making sacrifices. 
The creature accepts a  minor risk or sacrifice to do 
as asked. 
The creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to 
do as asked. 

Indifferent Creature's Reaction 
The creature offers  no he lp but does no harm . 
The creature does as as ked as long as  no risks or 
sacrifices  are  involved. 
The creature accepts a mi nor ris k or sacrifice to do 
as asked. 

Hostile Creature's Reaction 
The creature opposes t he adve ntu rers ' actions and 
might take risks to do so. 
The creature offers  no help but does no ha rm. 
The creature does as asked as long as  no ris ks or 
sacrifices a re involved. 

Aiding the Check. Other characters who make 

substantial contributions to the conversation can help 
the character making the check. If a helping character 
says or does something that would influence the 
interaction in a positive way, the character making 
the Charisma check can do so with advantage.  If 
the other character inadvertently says something 
counterproductive or offensive, the character making 
the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check. 
Multiple Checks. Certain situations might call for 
more than one check, particularly if the adventurers 
come into the interaction with multiple goals. 

4.  REPEAT? 
Once a Charisma check has been made, further 
attempts to  influence the target of the interaction might 
be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the 
subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward 
hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the 
party's rogue says something that pushes a noble's 
attitude toward the party from indifferent to  hostile, 
another character might be able to diffuse the noble's 
hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful 
Charisma (Persuasion) check. 

RoLEPLAYING 
For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't 
come naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is 
for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters 
and to amuse your players in the process. You  don't 
need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to  create 
drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to  the story 
elements and characterizations that make your players 
laugh or feel  emotionally engaged and to incorporate 
those things into your roleplaying. 

BEING THE NPC 
Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life 
would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares 
about. Does it have any ideals, flaws , or bonds? By 
working such things into your portrayal, you not only 
make the character or monster more believable, but you 
also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a 
living world. 

Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists 
into the game. For example, an old woman whose family 
was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard 
the party's wizard with grave suspicion. 

However you roleplay a character or monster, the 

classic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For 
example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and 
self-centered, have the individual act the way you would 
expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The 
NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, 
an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a 
desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of 
every conversation. 

USING YOUR VOICE 
Most of what you say during a session will be at a 
consistent level.  For dramatic effect, be ready to shout 
out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper. 

CHAPTER 8  /  RUNNING THE  GAME 

245 

Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices 

are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or actor, 
borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the 
movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice 
different voices and impersonations of famous people, 
then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life. 
Experiment with different speech patterns. For 

instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use 
their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak 
in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. 
Let a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, maties!" in your best Long 
John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar 
with Common stumble along with awkward grammar. 
Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred 
speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats. 

In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure 

the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk 
to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one 
NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need 
to  talk, give them distinct voices so the players know 
who's who. 

UsiNG YouR FAcE AND ARMS 
Use your facial expressions to help show a character's 
emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your 
eyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or 
monster memorable to the players. When you combine 
facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character 
truly comes to life. 

Though you don't need to stand up out of your chair, 

you can use your arms to bring even more life to an 
NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while 
speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage 
might express her displeasure by silently rolling her 
eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers . 

ENGAGING THE  PLAYERS 
Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more 
than others. Whatever your players' tastes, your 
lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire 
players to make just as much investment in portraying 
their characters. This makes social interactions an 
opportunity for everyone to become more immersed 
in the game, creating a story whose protagonists 
have depth. 

To make sure everyone has something to do during a 

roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of 
the following approaches. 

Appeal to Player Preferences. There are in-game 

activities that players enjoy more than others, as 
discussed in this book's  introduction. Players who like 
acting thrive in interaction situations, and it's fine to ·let 
those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other 
players by their example, but make sure those other 
players have an opportunity to join in the fun. 

Players who like exploring and storytelling are 

usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the 
campaign forward and reveals more about the world. 
Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring 
out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude. 
Players who are instigators like provoking reactions 
from NPCs, so they're often easily engaged-though not 
always productively. 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME 

P layers who like to optimize their characters and 
slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict 
within an interaction can help those players embrace 
roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an 
extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending 
assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way r 
keep action-focused players engaged. 

Target Specific Characters. Create situations where 
characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a 
social interaction have to  do at least some of the talk in 
Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or 
a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to 
that character. An NPC of a certain race or class mighr 
listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. 
Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to ge(cid:173)
specific players engaged, but don't shut out players who 
are already roleplaying. 

If a couple of players are dominating the conversation 

take a moment now and then to involve the others. You 
can do this in character if you like: "And what about you;(cid:173)
hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge 
in exchange for my favor? " Or just ask the player what 
his or her character is doing while the conversation is 
going on. The first approach is better for players who are 
already comfortable speaking in their characters' voices 
The second approach works better for players who neeri 
encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario. 

OBJECTS 
When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a 
window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and 
fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, 
characters can destroy any destructible object. Use 
common sense when determining a character's succe 
at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a 
section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is 
likely to break before the wall does. 

For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete. 

inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, 
table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is 
composed of many other objects. 

STATISTICS  FOR OBJECTS 
When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class 
and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give 
it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific 
types of damage. 

Armor Class. An object's Armor Class is a measure 
of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when 
striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging 
out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides 
suggested AC values for various substances.

and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.

Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are 
of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, 
such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or 
massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge 
tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus 
to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's 
hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long 
the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is 
acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, 
divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each 
section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those 
sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a 
Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when 
one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. 

Objects and Damage Types. Objects are immune 

to poison and psychic damage. You might decide 
that some damage types are more effective against a 
particular object or substance than others. For example, 
bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things 
but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or 
cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire  and lightning 
damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively 
cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. 

Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls 

often have extra resilience represented by a damage 
threshold. An object with a damage threshold has 
immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount 
of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it 
takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet 
or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered 
superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points. 

COMBAT 
This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's 
Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game running 
smoothly when a fight breaks out. 

TRACKING INITIATIVE 
You can use several different methods for keeping track 
of who goes when in combat. 

HIDDEN  LIST 
Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players 
can't see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen 

or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method 
allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't been 
revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place 
to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as 
other useful notes. 

A downside of this approach is that you have to remind 
the players round after round when their turns come up. 

VISIBLE  LIST 
You  can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the 
players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on 
the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving 
space between each name. Either write the monsters' 
initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to  the 
list on each monster's first turn. 

As a further improvement, use magnets that you can 

attach to  a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and 
monsters' names written on them, or write those names 
on cards held in place by magnets. 

A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. 

Players know when their turns are coming up, and they 
can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list 
also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters 
will act in the fight. 

A variation on the visible list is to give one player 

responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on 
a white board or on a piece of paper the other players 
can see. This method reduces the number of things you 
need to keep track of yourself. 

INDEX  CARDS 
In this approach, each character gets an index card, as 
does each group of identical monsters. When the players 
tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on 
their characters' index cards. Do the same when you roll 
the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order 
from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move 
down through the stack. When you call out the name of 
the character whose turn it is, also mention who's next, 
prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After 
each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is 
moved to the bottom of the stack. 

At first,  players don't know the order of play when 

you use combat cards, and they don't know where the 
monsters fall  into the order until the monsters act. 

TRACKING MONSTER HIT POINTS 
During a combat encounter, you need to track how much 
damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage 
in secret so that their players don't know how many hit 
points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to 
be secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that 
every monster's hit points be tracked individually. 
Tracking damage for  one or two monsters isn't 

onerous, but it helps to  have a system for larger 
groups of monsters. If you aren't using miniatures 
or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track 
of your monsters is to assign them unique features. 
Descriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar" 
and "the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your 
players track which monster is which. For example, 
imagine that you're running an encounter with three 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING THE  GAME 

247 

ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative 
is rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes 
(and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one: 
Krag  (ogre wf  scar):  59 
Thod  (ogre wf  helm):  59 
Mur  (ogre who smells like  poo):  59 

If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one 
easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a 
unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to 
represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures 
with small stickers of different colors or stickers with 
different letters or numbers on them. 

For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, 

you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged 
with stickers marked A, B, and C,  respectively. To track 
the ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then 
subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. 
Your records might look something like this after a few 
rounds of combat: 

Ogre A:  59~ 45 ~ t4 9 dead 
Ogre B:  59 5t 30 
Ogre C:  59 

Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever 

feel as though you need to  reveal exact hit points, but if 
a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to 
say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. 
You  can describe a monster taken to  half its hit points as 
bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight 
against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when 
to use their most powerful spells and abilities. 

USING AND  TRACKING  CONDITIONS 
Various rules and features in the game are clear abour 
when they apply a condition to a creature. You  can also 
apply conditions on the fly.  They're meant to be intuitiYe 
for you to  do so. For example, if a character is in a state 
such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say 
the character is unconscious. Or did a character just 
stumble onto the ground? He or she is now prone. 
Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. 

For monsters, it's often easiest to  track conditions on 
combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players 
should remember any conditions affecting their 
characters. Because players have incentive to forget or 
overlook hampering conditions, character conditions 
can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard. 

You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on 

hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then 
hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. 
Having a bright pink index card on top of a character 
sheet can help even the most absentminded player 
remember the effects of being charmed or frightened. 

MONSTERS AND  CRITICAL HITS 
A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as 
a player, character. That said, if you use a monster's 
average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder 
how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores 
a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with 
the hit and add them to the average damage. For 
example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (ld6 + 2) slashing 
damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + l d6 
slashing damage.

IMPROVISING  DAMAGE 
A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of 
damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to 
determine damage on the fly.  The Improvising Damage 
table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to 
how deadly these damage numbers are for characters 
of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level 
with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of 
the damage.

In contrast, dangerous damage values pose a 
significant threat to weaker characters and could 
potentially kill a character of the level shown if that 
character is missing many hit points. 

As the name suggests, deadly damage is enough 

to drop a character of the level shown to  0 hit points. 
This level of damage can kill even powerful characters 
outright if they are already wounded. 

ADJUDICATING AREAS  OF  EFFECT 
Many spells and other game feat ures create areas of 
effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you're not 
using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes 
be difficult to determine who's in an area of effect and 
who isn't. The easiest way to address such uncertainty 
is to go with your gut and make a call. 

If you would like more guidance, consider using 

the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To  use the table, 
imagine which combatants are near one another, and 
let the table guide you in determining the number of 
those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. 
Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the 
potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine 
the amount to add or subtract.

Damage sufficient to cause a setback rarely poses 

a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but 
a severely weakened character might be laid low by 
this damage. 

For example, if a wizard directs burning hands (a 

15-foot cone) at a nearby group of orcs, you could use 
the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 + 10 
= 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNN lNG THE  GAME 

249 

launch a lightning bolt (100-foot line) at some ogres 
and hobgoblins, and you could use the table to say 
four of the monsters are targeted (100 + 30 = 3.33, 
rounded up to  4). 

This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial 

precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider 
using miniatures. 

HANDLING MOBS 
Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be 
difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved 
in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you 
can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of 
approximating the average number of hits a large group 
of monsters can inflict on a target. 

Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the 

minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a 
target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target's 
AC. You'll need to refer to the result throughout the 
battle, so it's best to write it down. 

Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob 

Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures 
that need that die roll or higher must attack a target 
in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures 
attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of 
them hitting the target. 

For example, eight orcs surround a fighter. The orcs' 
attack bonus is +5, and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs 
need a  14 or higher to  hit the fighter. According to the 
table, for every three orcs that attack the fighter, one 
of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of 
three. The remaining two orcs fail  to hit the fighter. 
If the attacking creatures deal different amounts 
of damage, assume that the creature that deals the 
most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that 
hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, 
assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a 
creature's attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve 
each attack separately. 

This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in 

favor of reducing the number of die rolls. As the number 
of combatants dwindles, switch back to using individual 
die rolls to avoid situations where one side can't possibly 
hit the other.

USING MINIATURES 
In combat, players can often rely on your description 
to visualize where their characters are in relation to 
their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex 
battles, however, are easier to  run with visual aids, the 
most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If y 
like to construct model terrain, build three-dimension 
dungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you sho  -
also consider using miniatures. 

The Player's Handbook offers simple rules for 

depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. T'- -
section expands on that material. 

TACTICAL MAPS 
You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a 
wet-erase vinyl mat with  l-inch squares, on a large sh  -
of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster(cid:173)
sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, anc. 
terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fu n. 

The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foo:: 
square, and maps with grids are readily available and 
easy to create. However, you don't have to use a grid a 
all. You  can track distances with a  tape measure, string 
craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. 
Another option is a play surface covered by  l-inch 
hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the eas_ 
counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of 
using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls 
and right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though.

CREATURE  SIZE ON  SQUARES A  D  HEXES 
A creature's size determines how much space it 
occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature 
Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a 
monster takes up an amount of space different from 
what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster 
as its official size for all other rules. For example, 
you might use a miniature that has a Large base to 
represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space 
on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still 
Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.

A REAS  OF EFFECT 
The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other 
feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to 
determine which potential targets are in the area and 
which aren't. 

Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the 

point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules 
as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at 
least half a square, it affects that square. 

L INE  OF  SIGHT 
To precisely determine whether there is line of sight 
between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and 
rrace an imaginary line from that corner to any part 
of another space. If at least one such line doesn't pass 
through or touch an object or effect that blocks vision(cid:173)
such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of 
fog-then there is line of sight. 

C OVER 
To determine whether a target has cover against an 
attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the 

anacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. 
Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every 
corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or 
two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including 
another creature), the target has half cover. If three or 
four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still 
reach the target (such as when the target is behind an 
arrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover. 

On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing 

lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target 
has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an 
obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines 
a re blocked but the attack can still reach the target. 

OPTIONAL RULE :  FLANKING 
If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives 
combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack 
rolls against a common enemy. 

A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A 
creature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A 
Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least 
one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking. 

Flanking on Squares. When a creature and at 

least one of its allies are adjacent to  an enemy and on 
opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they 
flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on 
melee attack rolls against that enemy. 

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank 
an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between 
the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes 
through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, 
the enemy is flanked. 

Flanking on Hexes. When a creature and at least one 

of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite 
sides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and 
each of them has advantage on attack rolls against 
that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from 
one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller 
creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between 
them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there 
are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, 
they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a 
Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes 
between them.

CHAPTER 8  I  RUNNlNG THE  GAME 

OPTIONAL RULE:  DIAGONALS 
The Player's Handbook presents a simple method for 
counting movement and measuring range on a grid: 
count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving 
diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws 
of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This 
optional rule provides more realism, but it  requires 
more effort during combat. 

When measuring range or moving diagonally on a 

grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet,  but the 
second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern 
of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're 
counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or 
vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. 
For example, a character might move one square 
diagonally (5  feet),  then three squares straight (15 feet), 
and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total 
movement of 30 feet. 

OPTIONAL RuLE :  FACING 
If you want the precision of knowing which way a 
creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. 

Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its 

facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it 
faces),  left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature 
can also change its facing as a reaction when any other 
creature moves. 

A creature can normally target only creatures in its 

front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This 
means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes 
attack rolls against it with advantage. 

Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks 

from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For 
example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it 
only against attacks from  the front and left arcs. 

Feel free to  determine that not all creatures have 

every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre 
jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a 
hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. 

On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space 

as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line 
outward from each corner of this side to determine the 
squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space 
determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining 
spaces to  either side of the creature form its side arcs. 
On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs 

requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's 
space and create a wedge shape expanding out from 
there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side 
of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to 
either side of the creature are its side arcs. 

A square or hex might be in more than one arc, 

depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's 
space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one 
arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, 
use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that 
arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in 
the side arc. 

CHAPTER  8  \  RUNNING THE  GAME 

ADJUDICATING REACTION TIMING 
Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack 
and the Ready action for most of their reactions in a 
fight. Various spells and features give a creature more 
reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reacti  -
can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: 
follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's 
description. For example, the opportunity attack and 
the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can 
interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing 
specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs 
after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action. 

CHASES 
Strict application of the movement rules can turn a 
potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. 
Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while 
creatures with the same speed never close the distance 
between each other. This set of rules can make chase 
more exciting by introducing random elements. 

BEGINNING A  CHASE 
A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any 
participants not already in initiative order must roll 
initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase 
can take one action and move on its turn. The chase 
ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. 

When a chase begins, determine the starting 

distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track 
the distance between them, and designate the pursuer 
closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer migh· 
change from round to round. 

RUNNING THE  CHASE 
Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to  use 
the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to casr 
spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their 
quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught. 

DASHING 
During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash 
action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution 
modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during 
the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one !eve. 
of exhaustion. 

A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion 
reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature 
can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the 
chase by finishing a short or long rest. 

SPELLS AND ATTACKS 
A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells 
against other creatures within range. Apply the 
normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks 
and spells. 

Chase participants can't normally make opportunity 
attacks against each other, since they are all assumed 
to be moving in the same direction at the same time. 

However, participants can  till be -·  e rarge  of 
opportunity attacks from creatw .:  o  participating 
in the chase. For example. ad,·en  -e 
-ho chase a 
thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke 
opportunity attacks from the thug  . 

ENDING A  CHASE 
A chase ends when one s ide or the other  tops, when  the 
quarry escapes, or when the pursuer  are close enough 
to  their quarry to catch it. 

If neither side gives up the cha  e. the quarry ma kes a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each rou nd, after 
every participant in the chase ha  taken its turn. The 
result is compared to the passive\  isdom (Perception) 
scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple 
creatures, they all make the check. 

If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, 

the check fails automatically.  Otherwise, if the result of 
the quarry's check is greater than the highest passive 
score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues 
for another round. 

The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its 

check based on prevailing circumstances , as shown in 
the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the 
quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, 
the quarry has neither, as usual. 

EscAPE  FACTORS

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability 
to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with 
a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on 
checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot. 

Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has 

outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban 
setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a 
crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to 
where it went. 

CHASE  COMPLICATIONS 
As with any good chase scene, complications can arise 
to  make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban 
Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase 
Complications table provide several examples. 

Complications occur randomly. Each participant in 

the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the 
appropriate table to determine whether a complication 
occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in 
the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the 
die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant 
affected by the complication can spend inspiration to 
negate the complication.

DESIGNING YouR OwN  CHASE TABLES 
The tables presented here don't work for all possible 
environments. A chase through the sewers of 
Baldur's Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys 
of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your 
own table. 

SPLITTING UP 
Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. 
This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces 

or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit 
splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase 
separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of 
the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each 
separate group. 

MAPPING THE  CHASE 
If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take 
the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. 
Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that 
require the characters to make ability checks or saving 
throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random 
table of complications similar to the ones in this section. 
Otherwise, improvise as you play. 

Complications can be barriers to progress or 

opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased 
through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest 
and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw 
rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers. 

A map of a chase can be linear or have many 

branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For 
example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) 
branches, while a sewer chase might have several. 

ROLE REVERSAL 
During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become 
the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief 
through a ma rketplace might draw unwanted attention 
from other members of the thieves' guild. As they 
pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves 
pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and 
run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, 
the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his 
accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide 
to  flee with the thieves in pursuit. 

SIEGE  EQUIPMENT 
Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other 
wa lled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns 
that feature war. Most siege weapons don't move around 
a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move 
them, as well as to  load, aim, and fire them. 

BALLISTA 
Large object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 50 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. 
Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It 
takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, 
and one action to fire it. 

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to  hit, range 120/480 

ft.,  one target. Hit: 16 (3dl0) piercing damage. 

CANNON 
Large object 
Armor Class: 19 
Hit Points: 75 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A ca nnon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast 
iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign 
without gunpowder, a cannon might be an a rcane device 
built by clever gnomes or wizardly engineers. 

A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame 
with wheels. Before it can be fired , the cannon must 
be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the 
weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to  fire it. 

Cannon Ball. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to 

hit, range 600/2,400 ft. , one target. Hit: 44 (8d10)

CAULDRON,  SUSPENDED 
Large object 
Armor Class: 19 
Hit Points: 20 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A cauldron is an iron pot suspended so that it can be 
tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a 
cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually 
be reheated- before it can be used again. It takes three 
actions to fill  a cauldron and one action to tip it. 

Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as 

acid or green slime, with different effects. 

Boiling Oil. The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a 

10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the 
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
10 (3d6) fire  damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 

MANGONEL 
Large object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 100 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A mangonel is a type of catapult that hurls heavy 
projectiles in a high arc. This payload can hit targets 
behind cover. Before the mangonel can be fired, it must 
be loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the 
weapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it. 
A mangonel typically hurls a heavy stone, although it 

can hurl other kinds of projectiles, with different effects. 

Mangone} Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 
range 200/800 ft.  (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it),

Hit Points: 100 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a 
heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains. 
The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors 
and barricades. 

It takes a minimum of four Medium creatures to 

operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof,  these 
operators have total cover against attacks from above. 

Ram. Melee  Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft.,  one 

object. Hit:  16 (3d 10) bludgeoning damage.

Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A siege tower is a mobile wooden structure with a beam 
frame and slats in its walls. Large wooden wheels or 
rollers allow the tower to be pushed or pulled by soldie  "' 
or beasts of burden. Medium or smaller creatures can 
use the siege tower to reach the top of walls up to 40 
feet high. A creature in the tower has total cover from 
attacks outside the tower. 

TREBUCHET 
Huge object 
Armor Class: 15 
Hit Points: 150 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 

A trebuchet is a powerful catapult that throws its 
payload in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind cover. 
Before the trebuchet can be fired , it must be loaded and 
aimed. It takes two actions to load the weapon, two 
actions to  aim it, and one action to fire it. 

A trebuchet typically hurls a heavy stone. However, it 
can launch other kinds of projectiles, such as barrels of 
oil or sewage, with different effects. 

Trebuchet Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit.

DISEASES 
A plague ravages the kingdom , setting the adventurers 
on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from 
an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon 
finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock 
offends some dark power and contracts a strange 
affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells. 

A simple outbreak might amount to little more than 
a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting 
of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can 
form the basis of one or more adventures as characters 
search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and 
deal with the consequences. 

A disease that does more than infect a few party 
members is primarily a plot device. The rules help 
describe the effects of the disease and how it can be 
cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't 
bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect 
any creature, and a given illness might or might not 
pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A 
plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep 
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races 
untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell. 

SAMPLE  DISEASES 
The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease 
can work in the game. Feel free to  alter the saving 
throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other 
characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. 

~ACKLE FEVER 
-:-his disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are 
:;rrangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, 
·ctims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, 
givi ng the disease its common name and its morbid 
::Uckname: "the shrieks." 

Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and 

mclude fever and disorientation. The infected creature 
gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until 
Lhe disease is cured. 

Any event that causes the infected creature great 
-rress- including entering combat, taking damage, 
experiencing fear, or having a nightmare- forces the 
creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. 
Dn a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic 
da mage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter 
or 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw 
ar the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter 
and the incapacitated condition on a success. 

Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 

ieet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter 
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or 
also become infected with the disease. Once a creature 
ucceeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter 
of that particular infected creature for  24 hours. 

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a 
uccessful  save, the DC for this save and for the save to 
avoid  an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the 
aving throw DC drops to  0,  the creature recovers from 
rhe disease. A creature that fails three of these saving 
rh rows gains a randomly determined form of indefinite 
madness, as described later in this chapter. 

S EWER PLAGUE 
Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category 
of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, 
and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes 
tra nsmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such 
as rats and otyughs. 

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that 

carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with 
fi lth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 11  Constitution saving throw or 
become infected. 

It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to 
manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include 
fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one 
level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal 
number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit 
points from finishing a long rest. 

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 

must make a DC 11  Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. 
On a successful save, the character's ex haustion level 
decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw 
reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 
1, the creature recovers from the disease. 

SIGHT RoT 
This painful infection causes bleed ing from the eyes and 
eventually blinds the victim. 

A beast or humanoid  that drinks water tainted by 

sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or become infected. One day after infection, the 
creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature 
takes a - 1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks 
that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the 
symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When 
it reaches - 5, the victim is blinded until its sight is 
restored by magic such as Jesser restoration or heal. 

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called 

Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, 
a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit 
can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied 
to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents 
the disease from worsening after that rest. After three 
doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. 
PorsoNs 
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are 
illegal in  most societies but are a favorite tool among 
assassins, draw, and other evil  creatures. 

Poisons come in the following four types. 
Contact. A creature that touches contact poison with 

exposed skin suffers its effects. 

Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of 

ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide 
that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing 
advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half 
damage on a failed save. 

Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that 
take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 
5-foot cube. 

Injury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing 

damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated 
with injury poison is exposed to its effects.

SAMPLE  POISONS -------
Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects. 
Assassin's Blood (Ingested). A creature subjected 
to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING  THE  GAME 

257 

and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the 
creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned. 

Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). A creature subjected 

to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must 
repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. 
On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 
(1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the 
poison ends. 

Carrion Crawler Mucus (Contact). This poison 

must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated 
carrion crawler. A creature subjected to this poison 
must succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw 
or be poisoned for  1 minute. The poisoned creature is 
paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 

Drow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically made 
only by the draw, and only in a place far removed from 
sunlight. A creature subjected to  this poison must 
succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned for  1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or 
more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned 
in this way. The creature wakes up if it  takes damage or 
if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. 
Essence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected 
to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The 
poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes 
up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an 
action to shake it awake. 

Malice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to  this poison 

must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or become poisoned for  1 hour. The poisoned creature 
is blinded. 

Midnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that ingests 

this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. 
If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the 
creature must succeed on a DC 17  Constitution saving 
throw, taking 31  (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Oil ofTaggit (Contact). A creature subjected to this 
poison must succeed on a DC  13 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned 
creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it 
takes damage. 

Pale Tincture (Ingested). A creature subjected to this 

poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving 
throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become 
poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving 
throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damag<: 
on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage 
the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After 
seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the 
creature can heal normally. 

Purple Worm Poison (Injury). This poison must be 
harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. 
A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 
19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 

CHAPTER 8  I RUNNING THE  GAME 

Serpent Venom (Injury). This poison must be 

harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonou 
snake. A creature subjected to  this poison must succeed 
on a DC  11  Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 

Torpor (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison 

must succeed on a DC  15 Constitution saving throw or 
become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature 
is incapacitated. 

Truth Serum (Ingested). A creature subjected to thi 

poison must succeed on a DC 11  Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for  1 hour. The poisoned 
creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the 
effect of a zone of truth spell. 

Wyvern Poison (Injury). This poison must be 

harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A 
creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 

PURCHASING POISON 
In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession 
and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or 
unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. 
Characters with criminal contacts might be able to 
acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might 
have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before 
they track down the poison they seek. 

The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single 

doses of various poisons. 

CRAFTING AND  HARVESTING POISO  -
During downtime between adventures, a character 
can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to 
create basic poison if the character has proficiency with 
a poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can 
craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients 
are available for purchase, and tracking down certain 
ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure. 

A character can instead attempt to harvest poison 

from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or 
carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or 
dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed 
by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency 
with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the 
character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a 
successful check, the character harvests enough poison 
for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is 
unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the 
check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the 
creature's poison. 

MADNESS 
In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad 
by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict 
day after day,  but sometimes the stress of being an 
adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign 
has a strong horror theme, you might want to use 
madness as a way to  reinforce that theme, emphasizing 

the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the 
adventurers face. 

GOING MAD 
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an 
otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact 
other plane a nd symbol, can cause insanity, a nd you can 
use the madness rules here instead of the spell  effects 
in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar 
effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of 
Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts 
can also break the psyche of a character who uses or 
becomes attuned to them. 

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires 

a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game 
includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9,  "Dungeon 
Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving 
throw instead. 

MADNESS  EFFECTS - - - - -
Madness can be short-term, long-term , or indefinite. 
Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term 
madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More 
horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in  long(cid:173)
term or indefin ite madness. 

A cha racter affl icted with short-term madness is 
subjected to a n effect from the Short-Term Madness 
table for  ldlO minutes. 

A character afflicted with long-term madness is 
subjected to  an effect from the Long-Term Madness 
table for  ldlO x 10 hours. 

A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains 
a new character fl aw from the Indefinite Madness table 
that lasts until cured. 

SHORT-TERM  MADNESS

01-10  The character feels  compelled to  repeat a specific 

activity over and  over,  such as washing hands, 
touching things,  praying, or counting coins. 

11-20  The character experiences vivid  hallucinations and 

has disadvantage on  ability checks. 

21-30  The character suffers extreme paranoia. The 
character has disadvantage on  Wisdom  and 
Charisma checks. 

31-40  The character regards  something  (usually the 

source of madness)  with  intense revulsion, as  if 
affected  by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/ 
sympathy spell. 

41-45  The character experiences a powerful delusion . 

Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or 
she is  under its effects. 

46-55  The character becomes attached to a "l ucky 

charm," such as a person or an  object, and  has 
disadvantage on  attack rolls,  ability checks,  and 
saving throws wh ile  more than  30 feet from  it. 

56-65  The character is  blinded  (25%)  or deafened  (75%). 
66-75  The character experiences  uncontrollable tremors 

or tics, which  impose disadvantage on  attack 
rolls , ability checks , and  saving throws that invo lve 
Strength or Dexterity. 

76-85  The character suffers from  partial  amnesia. The 

character knows who  he or she is  and  retains  racial 
traits and class features,  but doesn 't  recognize 
other people or remember anything that happened 
before the madness took effect. 

86-90  Whenever the character takes damage,  he  or she 
must succeed on  a DC  15  Wisdom  saving throw 
or be affected as though  he  or she failed  a saving 
throw against the confusion  spell. The confusion 
effect lasts for  1 minute. 

91 -95  The character loses the ability to  speak. 
96-100  The character falls  unconscious . No  amount of 

jostling or damage can wake the character. 

CURING MADNESS 
A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of 
madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid 
a character of a short-term or long-term madness. 
Depending on the source of the madness, remove 
curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater 
restoration spell  or more powerful magic is required to 
rid a character of indefinite madness. 

EXPERIENCE  POINTS 
Experience points (XP) fuel  level advancement for 
player characters and are most often the reward for 
completing combat encounters. 

Each monster has an XP value based on its 

challenge rating. When adventurers defeat one or more 
monsters-typically by killing, routing, or capturing

them-they divide the total XP value of the monsters 
evenly among themselves. If the party received 
substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count 
those NPCs as party members when dividing up the 
XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight  easier, individual 
characters receive fewer XP.) 

Chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," provides 

guidelines for designing combat encounters using 
experience points. 

ABSENT  CHARACTERS 
Typically, adventurers earn experience only for 
encounters they ·participate in. If a player is absent 
for a session, the player's character misses out on the 
experience points. 

Over time, you might end up with a level gap between 
the characters of players who never miss a session and 
characters belonging to  players who a re more sporadic 
in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap 
of two or three levels between different characters in 
the same party isn't going to  ruin the game for anyone. 
Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in 
the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is 
good incentive for players to attend as many sessions 
as possible. 

As an alternative, give absent characters the same 

XP that the other characters earned each session, 
keeping the group at the same level. Few players 
will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just 
because they know they'll receive XP for it even if they 
don't show up. 

NONCOMBAT CHALLE ..  GES ------:-
You  decide whether to award experience to characters 
for overcoming challenges out  ide combat. If the 
adventurers complete a ten  e negotiation with a baron, 
forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, 
or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might 
decide that they deserve an XP  rewa rd. 

As a starting point, use the rules for building combat 

encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the 
challenge. Then award the cha racters XP as if it had 
been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only 
if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of fa ilure. 

MILESTONES 
You  can also award XP when characters complete 
significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, 
designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as 
with the following exampl es: 

Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to 
complete the adventure. 
Discovering a hidden location or piece of information 
relevant to the adventure. 
Reaching an important destination. 

When awarding XP,  treat a major milestone as a hard 
encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter. 
If you want to reward your players for their progress 

through an adventure with something more than XP 
and treasure, give them additional small rewards at 
milestone points. Here are some examples: 

The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest. 
Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level 
spell slot. 
Characters can regain the use of magic items that 
have had their limited uses expended. 

LEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP 
You  can do away with experience points entirely and 
control the rate of character advancement. Advance 
characters based on how many sessions they play, or 
when they accomplish significant story goals in the 
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their 
characters gain a level. 

This method of level advancement can be particularly 

helpful if your campaign doesn't include much 
combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP 
becomes tiresome. 

SESSION- BASED ADVANCEMENT 
A good rate of session-based advancement is to have 
characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 
3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two 
more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for 
each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard 
rate  of advancement, assuming sessions are about four 
hours long. 

STORY- BASED ADVANCEMENT 
When you let the story of the campaign drive 
advancement, you award levels when adventurers 
accomplish significant goals in  the campaign.

CHAPTER 9:  DuNGEON MASTER's WoRKSHOP 

S  THE D UNGEON M AS TER, YOU AREN'T LIMITED 
by the rules in the Player's Handbook , the 
guidelines in this book, or the selection of 
monsters in the Monster Manual. You can 
let your imagination run wild. This chapter 
contains optional rules that you can use to 

customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on 
creating your own material , such as monsters and 
magic items. 

The options in this chapter relate to many different 

parts of the game. Some of them are variants of 
rules, a nd others are entirely new rules. Each option 
represents a different genre, style of play, or both. 
Consider trying no more than one or two of the options 
at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on 
your campaign before adding other options. 

Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask 

yourself two questions: 

•  Will the rule improve the game? 
•  Will my players like it? 
If you're confident that the answer to  both questions is 
yes, then you have nothing to  lose by giving it a try. Urge 
your players to  provide feedback. If the rule or game 
element isn't functioning as intended or isn't adding 
much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it.  No 
matter what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the 
other way around. 

Beware of adding anything to your game that allows 

a character to concentrate on more than one effect at 
a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action 
per round , or attune to more than three magic items 
at a time. Rules and game elements that override the 
rules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and 
magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or 
overcomplicate your game. 

ABILITY OPTIONS 
The optional rules in this section pertain to  using 
ability scores. 

------------------

PROFICIENCY DICE 
This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency 
bonus with a proficiency die, adding more ra ndomness 
to the game and making proficiency a less reliable 
ind icator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency 
bonus to  an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, 
the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die 
table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by 
the character's level. 

Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, 
lets a cha racter double his or her proficiency bonus, 
the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice 
instead of once. 

This option is intended for player characters and 

non player characters who have levels, as opposed to 
monsters who don't.

SKILL VARIANTS 
A skill dictates the circumstances under which a 
character can add his or her proficiency bonus to a n 
ability check. Skills define those circumstances by 
referring to  different aspects of the six ability scores. 
For example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different 
aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in 
either or both. 

You  can dispense with skills and  use one of the 

following variants. Choose whichever one best suits 
your campaign. 

ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency 
in two abilities: one tied to the character's class and 
one tied to  the character's background. The Ability 
Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for 
each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a 
given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds 
his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to 
one or the other of these two abilities. 

ABILITY  CHECK  PROFICIENCIES  BY  CLASS 

Ability Check 

Class 
Barbarian  Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Bard 
Cleric 
Druid 
Fighter 
Monk 
Paladin 
Ranger 
Rogue 
Sorcerer 
Warlock 
Wizard

Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma 
Strength, Dexterity,  or Wisdom

Intelligence or Charisma 
Intelligence or Charisma

The Expertise feature works differently than normal 

under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two 
skill  proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class 
feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she 
has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two 
of the character's Expertise choices. If the character 
would ga in an additional skill proficiency, that character 
instead selects a nother ability check in which to gain 
proficiency. 

H  PTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP 

This option removes skills from the game and 

doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. 
For example, a character can't choose to emphasize 
persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally 
adept at both. 

BACKGROUND  PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool 
proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character 
a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, 
a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any 
ability check to which the character's prior training and 
experience (reflected in the character's background) 
reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of 
whether the character's background applies. 

For example, the player of a character with the noble 
background could reasonably argue that the proficiency 
bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character 
makes to secure an audience with the king. The player 
should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how 
the character's background applies. Not simply "I'm 
a noble," but "I spent three years before starting my 
adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador 
to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature 
to me now." 

This simple system relies heavily on players 

developing their characters' histories. Don't let it 
result in endless debates about whether a character's 
proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless 
a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the 
character's background makes everyone else at the table 
roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the 
player for making the effort. 

If a character has the Expertise feature, instead 

of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of 
that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her 
background to which the benefit applies. Continuing 
the noble example, the player might decide to  apply 
Expertise to "situations where courtly manners and 
etiquette are paramount" and "figuring out the secret 
plots that court members hatch against one another." 

PERSONALITY TRAIT PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her 
proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to 
the character's positive personality traits. For example, 
a character with a positive personality trait of "I  never 
have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go 
along" might apply the bonus when engaging in some 
off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player 
should come up with at least four positive personalit)l 
traits when creating a character. 

When a character's negative personality trait directly 

impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage 
on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative 
trait is "I often get lost in my own thoughts and 
contemplation, oblivious to  my surroundings" might 
have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice 
creatures sneaking up. 

If a character has the Expertise feature , the player can 

apply its benefit to personality traits related to  ability 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would 
gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead 
gains a new positive personality trait. 

This system relies heavily on players developing 

their characters' personalities. Make sure that different 
characters' traits- positive and negative- come into play 
with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get 
away with a positive trait that always seems to  apply and 
a  negative trait that never does. 

At your discretion, you can also tie a character's 

ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system. 

HERO  POINTS 
Hero points work well in  epic fantasy and mythic 
campaigns in which the characters are meant to be 
more like superheroes than the average adventurer is. 
With this option, a character starts with 5 hero point 
at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or 
she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total 
equal to 5 + half the character's level. 

A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she 

makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw 
The player can spend the hero point after the roll is 
made but before any of its results are applied. Spend in_ 
the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it 
to  the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A 
player can spend only 1 hero point per roll. 

In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving 

throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the 
failure into a success. 

NEW ABILITY SCORES: 
HONOR AND  SANITY 
If you're running a campaign shaped by a strict code of 
honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding 
one or both these new ability scores: Honor and S ani _ 
These abilities function like the standard six abilities. 
with exceptions specified in each ability below. 

Here's how to  incorporate these optional abilities at 

character creation: 

If your players use the standard array of ability 
scores, add one 11  to the array for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 
3 points to the number of points for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll 
for the added ability scores. 

If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for 
Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you 
can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity. 

HoNOR ScoRE 
If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code 
of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor 
score as a  means of measuring a character's devotion 
to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired 
by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten 
Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any 
campaign that revolves  around orders of knights. 

Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a 
code but also the character's understand ing of it. The 
Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a 
character's honor. A character with a high Honor usually 
has a reputation that others know about, especially 
those who have high Honor scores themselves. 

Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with 

normal ability score increases. Instead, you  can award 
increases to Honor- or impose reductions- based on 
a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you 
think a character's actions in the adventure reflected 
well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, 
you can increase or decrease the character's Honor by 
1. As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't 
exceed 20 or fall  below 1. 

Honor Checks. Honor checks can be used in social 

situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's 
understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining 
factor in the way a social interaction will play out. 
You  might also call for an Honor check when a 

character is in one of the following situations: 

Being unsure how to act with honor 

•  Surrendering while trying to save face 

Trying to  determine another character's Honor score 
Trying to  use the proper etiquette in a delicate 
social situation 
Using his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation 
to  influence someone else 
Honor Saving Throws. An Honor saving throw 

comes into play when you want to  determine whether 
a character might inadvertently do something 
dishonorable. You  might call for an Honor saving throw 
in the following situations: 

Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette 
Resisting the urge to  respond to goading or insults 
from an enemy 
Recognizing when an enemy attempts to  trick a 
character into a breach of honor 

SANITY ScoRE 
Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign 
revolves around entities of an utterly alien and 
unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose 
powers and minions can shatter a character's mind. 

A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in 
the face of insane circumstances, while a character with 
low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted 
by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason. 

Sanity Checks. You might ask cha racters to  make a 
Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall 
lore about the alien creatures of madness featured 
in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving 
lunatics, or to  learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. 
You  might also call for a Sanity check when a character 
tries one of the following activities: 

Deciphering a piece of text written in a la nguage so 
alien that it threatens to  break a character's mind 
Overcoming the lingering effects of madness 

•  Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all 

normal understanding of magic 

Sanity Saving Throws. You  might call for a Sanity 

saving throw when a character runs the risk of 
succumbing to madness, such as in the following 
situations: 

Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien 
realms for the first time 

•  Making direct contact with th e mind of an 

alien creature 
Bei ng subjected to spells that affect mental stability, 
such as the insanity option of the symbol spell 
Passing through a demiplane built on alien physics 
Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that 
deals psychic damage 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

A fa iled Sanity save might result in short-term, long(cid:173)

term , or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, 
"Running the Game." Any time a character suffers from 
long-term or indefinite madness, the character's Sanity 
is reduced by  1. A greater restoration spell can restore 
Sanity lost in  this way, and a character can increase his 
or her Sanity through level advancement. 

ADVENTURING  OPTIONS 
This section provides options for changing how rests 
work, as well as for adding unusual things to your 
campaign, such as modern weapons. 

FEAR AND  HORROR 
The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an 
atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign. 

FEAR 
When adventurers confront threats they have no 
hope of overcoming, you can call  for them to  make a 
Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the 
circumstances. A character who fails th e save becomes 
frightened for  1 minute. The character can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, 
ending the effect on the character on a successful save. 

HORROR 
Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails 
revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer 
see something completely contrary to  the common 
understanding of what can and should  occur in the 
world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth. 

In such a situation, you can call on characters to make 
a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC 
based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. 
On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long(cid:173)
term form of madness that you choose or determine 
randomly, as detailed in chapter 8 , "Running the Ga me.-

HEALING 
These optional rules make it easier or harder for 
adventurers to recover from  injury, either increasing 
or reducing the amount of time your players can spend 
adventuring before rest is required. 

HEALER'S  KIT DEPENDENCY 
A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a 
short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's 
kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds. 

HEALING SuRGES 
This optional rule allows characters to heal up in 
the thick of combat and works well for  parties that 
feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for 
campaigns in which magical healing is rare. 

As an action, a character can use a healing surge and 

spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die 
spent in this way,  the player rolls the die and adds the 
character's Constitution modifier. The character regains 
hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to 
spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

A character who uses a healing surge ca n't do so 

again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. 

Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent 

Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, 
a character regains Hit Dice equal to  his or her level 
divided by four (minimum of one die). 

For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character 
use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as 
an action. 

SLOW NATURAL HEALING 
Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long 
rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at 
the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest. 

This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that 
characters need to recover from their wounds without 
the benefits of magical healing and works well for 
grittier, more realistic campaigns. 

REST VARIANTS 
The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter 
8 of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style 
campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes , 
take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be 
ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn't 
fit your campaign, consider the following variants. 

EPIC  HEROISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long 
rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, 
since characters can easily recover from every battle. 
You  might want to make combat encounters more 
difficult to compensate. 

Spellcasters using this system can afford to  burn 

through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. 
Consider allowing spellcasters to  restore expended 
spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots 
(rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to  limit 
spell  slots restored to 5th level or lower.  Only a full 
8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to  restore all spell 
slots and to  regain spell slots of 6th level or higher. 

GRITTY REALISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long 
rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, 
requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits 
and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to 
engage in too many battles in a row.  and all adventuring 
requires careful planning. 

This approach encourages the characters to 

spend time out of the dungeon. It"  a good option for 
campaigns that emphasize intrigue. politics. and 
interactions among other  PCs. and in which combat is 
rare or something to be avoided rather rhan rushed into. 

FIREARMS 
If you want to model the swa  hbuckling  r.yle of 
The  Three Musketeers and  imilar tale  . you can 
introduce gunpowder weapon  ro your campaign that 
are associated with the Renaissance. 
campaign where a space  hip h 
era  bed or elements 
of modern-day Earth are pre  en . fu  uri  tic or modern 

imilarly. in a 

firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides 
exa mples of firearms from  all  three of those periods. 
The modern and futuristic items are priceless. 

PROFICIENCY 
It's up to you to  decide whether a character has 
proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D 
worlds wouldn't have such proficiency. During their 
downtime, characters can use the training ru les in the 
Player 's Handbook to acq uire proficiency, assuming 
that they  have enough am muniti on to keep the weapons 
working while mastering their use. 

PROPERTIES 
Firea rms  use special ammuniti on, and some of them 
have the burst fire or reload property. 

Ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is 

destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms 
use bullets. Futuris tic firearms are powered by a 
specia l type of a mmunition called energy cells. An 
energy cell  contains enough power for all the shots its 
firearm can make. 

Burst Fire. A weapon that has the burst fire property 
can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 
10-foot-cube area within normal range w ith shots. Each 
creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take the weapon's  normal damage. This 
action uses ten pieces of ammunition. 

Reload. A limited number of shots can be made with 

a weapon that has the reload property. A character must 
then reload it  using an action or a bonus action (the 
character's choice). 

EXPLOSIVES 
A campaign might include explosives from the 
Renaissance or the modern world (the latter are 
priceless), as presented in the Explosives table. 

BOMB 
As an action, a character can li ght this  bomb and throw 
it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 
feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. 

GUNPOWDER 
Gunpowder is chiefly used to  propel a bu 11et out of the 
barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. 
Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water(cid:173)
resistant powder horns. 

S etting fire  to a container full  of gunpowder can cause 

it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures with in 
10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A 
successful  DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the 
damage. Setting fi re to an ounce of gunpowder causes 
it  to flare for  1 round, s hedding bright light in a 30-foot 
radius and dim light for an add itional 30 feet. 

DYNAMITE 
As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite 
and throw it at a point up to  60 feet away. Each creature 
within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a 
fail ed save, or half as much damage on a successful  one. 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so 

they explode at the same time. Each additional stick 
increases the damage by  1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) 
a nd the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet). 
Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode 

after a set amount of time, usually 1 to  6 rounds. Roll 
initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of 
rounds goes by,  the dynamite explodes on that initiative. 

GRENADES 
As a n action, a character can throw a grenade at a 
point up to  60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the 
character can propel the grenade up to  120 feet away. 

Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding 

fragmentation grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a 

cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in 
a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per 
hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind 
(20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

ALIEN TECHNOLOGY 
When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't 
from  their world or time period, the players might 
understand what the object is, but the characters 
rarely wi ll.  To simulate a character's ignorance about 
the technology, have the character make a series of 
Intelligence checks to figure it out. 

To  determine how the technology works, a character 

must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks 
based on the complexity of the item: two successes for 
a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or 
revolver) and fou r successes for a complex item (such a 
a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft).  Then consult the 
Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making 
the item break if a character fail s four or more times 
before taking a long rest. 

A character who has seen a n item used or has 

operated a similar item has advantage on Intelligence 
checks made to  figure out its use.

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

PLOT POINTS 
Plot points allow players to change the course of the 
campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the 
world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first 
reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that 
your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you. 

USING PLOT POINTS 
Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, 
a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect 
depends on your group's approach to this optional rule. 
Three options are presented below. 

A player can spend no more than  1 plot point 

per session. You  can increase this limit if you like, 
especially if you want the players to drive more of the 
story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot 
point, they each gain 1 plot point. 

OPTION 1:  WHAT A  TWIST! 
A player who spends a plot point gets to add some 
element to  the setting or situation that the group 
(including you) must accept as true. For example, a 
player can spend a plot point and state that his or her 
character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or 
a  monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed 
into a horrid beast. 

A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way 

should  take a minute to discuss his or her idea with 
everyone else at the table and get feedback before 
settling on a plot development. 

OPTION 2:  THE PLOT THICKENS 
Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to  his 
or her right must add a complication to the scene. For 
example, if the player who spends the plot point decides 
that her character has found a secret door, the player 
to the right might state that opening the door triggers a 
magical trap that teleports the party to  another part of 
the dungeon. 

OPTION  3:  THE  GODS  MUST BE  CRAZY 
With this approach, there is no permanent DM. 
Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as 
the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's 
character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the 
group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes. 

At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become 

the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and 
play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap 
roles in the middle of combat, but it ca n happen if your 
group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or 
her role and pick up where the previous DM left off. 

Using plot points in this way can make for an 

exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in 
unexpected directions. This approach is also a great 
way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, 
controlled doses. 

In a campaign that uses plot points this way,  everyone 
should come to  the table with a  bit of materia l prepared 
or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't 
prepared or who doesn't feel  like DMing can choose 
to not spend a plot point that session. 

For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish 

some sha red assumptions about the campaign so that 
DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each 
other's plans. 

COMBAT OPTIONS 
The options in this section provide alternative ways to 
handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these 
rules is slowing down play. 

INITIATIVE VARIANTS ----
This section offers different ways to handle initiative. 

INITIATIVE  ScoRE 

•  With this optional rule, creature don't roll initiative 
at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an 
initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 
10 +Dexterity modifier. 

By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, 

and the process of asking for and recording totals, you 
can speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an 
initiative order that is often predictable. 

SIDE  INITIATIVE 
Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangin 
everyone in  the correct order, and remembering where 
you are in  the list can bog the game down. If you want 
quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming 
unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule. 

Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their 

initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither 
roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins 
initiative. In case of a tie,  keep rerolling until the tie 
is broken. 

When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can 
act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side 
has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends 
when both sides have completed their turns. 

If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side 

rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to 
lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the 
battle is complete. 

This variant encourages teamwork and makes your 

life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate 
monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative 
can gang up on enemies and take them out before they 
have a chance to act. 

SPEED  FACTOR 
Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative 
too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use 
their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their 
decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might 
charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes 
before the monster a nd can heal him. 

Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces 

more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of 
play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll 
initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or 
monster must choose an action. 

Initiative Modifiers. Modifiers might apply to  a 
-eature's initiative depending on its size and the action 
- ra kes. For example, a creatu re that fi ghts with a light 
eapon or casts a simple spell  is more likely to act 
fore a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. 

:ee the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for 
:  rails. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has 
-
effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies 
such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon), 
.ipply them all to  the initiative roll.

Initiative Modifier

Don't apply the same modifier more than once on a 

creature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two 
daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse 
weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only 
the modifier from the highest-level spell. 

Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that 
creature's turn, remembering never to apply the 
same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 
2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a 
-hortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell 
and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total 
modifier of +0. 

The table is only a starting point. You  can refer to it 
when adjudicating any actions a character takes that 
you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions 
hould grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should 
incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or 
penalty of 2 or 5 for an action. 

For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a 
portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could 
ru le that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty. 

Rolling Initiative. After deciding on an action, 

everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping 
rhe result secret. You then announce an initiative 
number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to 
call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties 
by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act 
fi rst. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first. 

Turns. On its turn, a creature moves as normal but 
must take the action it selected or take no action at all. 

Once everyone has acted, the process  repeats. 

Everyone in the battle selects an action. rolls initiative, 
and takes turns in order. 

ACTION  OPTIO NS 
This s ection provides new action options for combat. 
They can be added as a group or individually to 
your game. 

CLIMB  ONTO A  BIGGER  CREATURE 
If one creature wants to jump onto a nother creature, it 
can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has 
little chance of making a successful grapple against a 
Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic 
has granted the grappler supernatural might. 

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be 
treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its 
back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability 
checks necessary to  get into position and onto the larger 
creature, the sma ller creature uses its action to make 
a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully 
moves into the target creature's space and clings to its 
body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature 
moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls 
against it. 

The smaller creature can move around within the 
larger creature's space, treating th e space as difficult 
terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the 
smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's 
location, and is left  to your discretion. The larger 
creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an 
action- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, 
or grabbing and throwing it- by making a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
The smaller creature chooses which ability to use. 

DISARM 
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon 
or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker 
makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength 
(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the 
attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage 
or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. 

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if 

the target is holding the item with two or more ha nds. 
The target has advantage on its ability check if it is 
larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it 
is smaller. 

MARK 
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to 
harry each other with opportunity attacks. 

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also 

mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn , 
any opportunity attack it makes against the marked 
target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't 
expend the attacker's reaction , but the attacker can't 
make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated 
condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it 
from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one 
opportunity attack per turn. 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

OVERRUN 
When a creature tries to  move through a hostile 
creature's space, the mover can try to force its way 
through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an 
action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the 
overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than 
the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If 
the mover wins the contest, it can move through the 
hostile creature's space once this turn. 

SHOVE ASIDE 
With this option, a creature uses the special shove 
attack from  the Player's Handbook to force a target 
to  the side, rather than away. The attacker has 
disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it 
does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves 
the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach. 

TUMBLE 
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's 
space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an 
action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the 
contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space 
once this turn. 

HITTING COVER 
When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, 
you can use this optional rule to  determine whether the 
cover was struck by the attack. 

First, determine whether the attack roll would have 
hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack 
roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target 
but high enough to strike the target if there had been 
no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature 
is providing cover for the missed creature and the 
attack roll  exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the 
covering creature is hit. 

CLEAVING THROUGH  CREATURES 
If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower(cid:173)
level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help 
speed up such fights. 

When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature 

to  0 hit points, any excess damage from  that attack 
might carry over to another creature nearby. The 
attacker targets another creature within reach and, if 
the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining 
damage to it.  If that creature was undamaged and is 
likewise reduced to  0 hit points, repeat this process, 
carrying over the remaining damage until there are no 
valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to 
reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. 

INJURIES _ __  _ 
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This 
option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering 

injury.  A creature might sustain a lingering injury under 
the following circumstances: 

When it takes a critical hit 
When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the 

Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical 
humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for 
creatures with different body types. 

LINGERING  INJURIES

Injury 
Lose an  Eye.  You  have disadvantage on Wisdom 
(Perception)  checks that rely on  sight and  on 
ranged attack rolls.  Magic such  as  the regenerate 
spell can  restore the lost eye.  If you  have  no eyes 
left after sustaining this  injury,  you're  blinded. 
Lose an  Arm or a Hand. You  can  no  longer hold 
anything with  two  hands, and you  can  hold  only a 
single object at a time.  Magic such as the regenerate 
spell can  restore the lost appendage. 
Lose a Foot or Leg.  Your  speed on  foot  is  halved, 
and you  must use a cane or crutch to move  unless 
you  have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You  fall 
prone after using the Dash  action. You  have 
disadvantage on  Dexterity checks made to balance. 
Magic such  as  the regenerate  spell can  restore the 
lost appendage. 
Limp. Your speed on  foot is  reduced  by  5 feet.  You 
must make a DC  10  Dexterity saving throw after 
using the  Dash action.  If you  fail  the save, you  fall 
prone.  Magical  healing removes the limp. 
Internal  Injury. Whenever you  attempt an  action 
in  combat, you  must make  a DC  15  Constitution 
saving throw.  On a failed  save, you  lose your action 
and can't use reactions  until  the start of your next 
turn. The injury heals  if you  receive  magical  healing 
or  if you  spend ten days  doing nothing but resting. 

8-10  Broken  Ribs. This  has the same effect as  Internal 

Injury above, except that the save DC  is  10. 

11-13  Horrible Scar. You  are disfigured to the extent that 

the wound can't be easily concealed . You  have 
disadvantage on  Charisma  (Persuasion)  checks 
and advantage on  Charisma  (Intimidation)  checks. 
Magical  healing of 6th  level  or higher,  such as  heal 
and regenerate,  removes the scar. 

14-16  Festering Wound. Your  hit  point maximum  is 

reduced  by  1 every  24  hours the wound  persists. 
If your hit  point maximum drops to 0,  you  die . 
The wound  heals  if you  receive  magical  healing. 
Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound  and 
make a DC  15  Wisdom  (Medicine)  check once every 
24  hours. After ten successes, the wound  heals. 
17-20  Minor Scar. The  scar doesn't have any  adverse 

effect.  Magica l healing of 6th  level  or higher,  such 
as  heal and regenerate,  removes the scar. 

Instead of using the effect described in  the table, you 
can put the responsibility of representing a character's 
lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the 
Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering 
the effect described for that resu lt, that character gains 
a new flaw with the same name. It's  up to  the player to 
express the lingering injury during play, just like any 
other flaw,  with the potential to gain inspiration when 
the injury affects the character in a meaningful way. 

MASSIVE  DAMAGE 
This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to  be 
felled by massive damage. 

When a creature takes damage from a single source 
equal to  or greater than half its hit point maximum, it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the 
System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a 
hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution 
save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source. 

SYSTEM  SHOCK 

dlO 

Effect 
The creature drops to 0  hit points . 

2-3  The creature drops to 0  hit  points  but is  stable. 
4-5  The creature is stunned  until  the end of its next turn . 
6-7  The creature can't take reactions and  has 

disadvantage on attack rolls  and  ability checks until 
the end of its  next turn. 

8-10  The creature can't take reactions  unti l the end of its 

next turn. 

MORALE 
Some combatants might run away when a fight turns 
against them. You  can use this optional rule to help 
determine when monsters and NPCs flee. 

A creature might flee  under any of the following 

circumstances: 

•  The creature is surprised. 

The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer 
for the first time in the battle. 
The creature has no way to harm the opposing side 
on its turn. 

A group of creatures might flee under any of the 

following circumstances: 

All  the creatures in the group are surprised. 
The group's leader is reduced to  0 hit points, 
incapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle. 

•  The group is reduced to half its original size with no 

losses on the opposing side. 

To determine whether a creature or group of 

creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
for the creature or the group's leader.  If the opposition 
is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with 
disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails 
automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving 
throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the 
group with the next highest Charisma score make the 
saving throw instead. 

On a failed save, the affectedereature or group flees 
by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, 
the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group 
that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle 
might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to 
flee or surrender will be made. 

A failed saving throw isn't always to  the adventurers' 

benefit. For exa mple, an ogre that flees from combat 
might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with 
treasure that the characters had hoped to  plunder. 

CREATING A  MONSTER 
The Monster Manual contains hundreds of ready-to-play 
monSters, but it doesn't include every monster that you 
can imagine. Part of the D&D experience is the simple 
joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing 
ones, if for  no other reason than to surprise and delight 
your players with something they've never faced before. 

The first step in the process is coming up with the 

concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where 
does it live? What role do you want it to serve in your 
adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does 
it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you 
have the answers to  these questions, you can start 
figuring out how to represent your monster in the game. 

MODIFYING A  MONSTER 
Once you have an idea for a monster, you'll need 
statistics to represent it. The first question you should 
ask yourself is:  Can I use statistics that already exist? 

A stat block in the Monster Manual might make a 

good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for 
example, that you want to create an intelligent a rboreal 
predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster 
in the Monster Manual,  but the quaggoth is a savage 
humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could 
borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, 
changing nothing but the creature's name. You  can also 
make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's 
language, Undercommon, with one that's more 
appropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan. 

Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give 
it immunity to fire,  and allow it to deal fire damage with 
its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon 
with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you 
can imagine can be built using one that already exists. 
Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than 

creating one from scratch, and there are changes you 
can make to an existing monster that have no effect 
on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, 
changing its alignment, or adding special senses. 
However, once you change the creature's offensive or 
defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its 
challenge rating might need to change, as shown later. 

S W ITC HING WEAPONS 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can 
replace that weapon with a different one.  For example, 
you could replace a hobgoblin's longsword with a 
halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the 
attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

273 

consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon 
to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example,  a 
hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon) 
loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decreases by 2. 

ADDING A  SPECIAL TRAIT 
Another simple way to customize a monster is to add 
a special trait. You can add a special trait of your own 
devising or pick up a special trait from one of the many 
creatures in the Monster Manual.  For example, you can 
create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal goblin 
the Spider Climb special trait, turn an ordinary troll  into 
a two-headed troll by giving it the Two Heads special 
trait, or turn an owlbear into a flying owlbear by giving it 
wings and a giant owl's flying speed. 

CREATING  UICK MONSTER STATS 
If all you need are simple stats for a monster of a 
particular challenge rating, follow the steps here. If you

want to create something more akin to  the monster 
stat blocks in the Monster Manual, skip ahead to the 
"Creating a Monster Stat Block" section. 

STEP 1.  EXPECTED  CHALLENGE  RATING 
Pick the expected challenge rating (CR) for your 
monster. Knowing the monster's expected challenge 
rating will help you figure out the monster's proficiency 
bonus and other important combat statistics. Don't 
worry about getting the challenge rating exactly right; 
you can make adjustments in later steps. 

A single monster with a challenge rating equal to 

the adventurers' level is, by itself, a fair challenge for a 
group of four characters. If the monster is meant to be 
fought in pairs or groups, its expected challenge rating 
should be lower than the party's level. 

Don't fall  into the trap of thinking that your monster 

must have a challenge rating equal to the level of the 
characters to be a worthy challenge. Keep in mind that 
monsters with a lower challenge rating can be a threat 
to  higher-level characters when encountered in groups. 

STEP 2. BASIC  STATISTICS 
Use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to 
determine the monster's Armor Class, hit points, attack 
bonus, and damage output per round based on the 
challenge rating you chose in step 1. 

STEP 3. ADJUST STATISTICS 
Raise or lower the monster's Armor Class, hit points, 
attack bonus, damage output per round, and save DC as 
you see fit,  based on whatever concept you have in mind 
for the monster. For example, if you need a well-armored 
monster, increase its Armor Class. 

Once you've made the desired adjustments, record 

the monster's statistics. If there are any other statistics 
you think the monster needs (such as ability scores), 
follow the appropriate steps under "Creating a Monster 
Stat Block." 

STEP 4.  FINAL CHALLENGE  RATING 
Calculate the monster's final challenge rating, 
accounting for the adjustments you made in step 3. 
Defensive Challenge Rating. Read down the Hit 

Points column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge 
Rating table until you find your monster's hit points. 
Then look across and note the challenge rating 
suggested for a monster with those hit points. 

Now look at the Armor Class suggested for a monster 
of that challenge rating. If your monster's AC is at least 
two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the 
challenge rating suggested by its hit points up or down 
by 1 for every 2 points of difference. 

Offensive Challenge Rating. Read down the Damage 

Round column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge 
Rating table until you find your monster's damage 
output per round. Then look across and note the 
challenge rating suggested for a monster that deals that 
much damage. 

Now look at the attack bonus suggested for a monster 
of that challenge rating. If your monster's attack bonus 
is at least two points higher or lower than that number, 

274 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER' S  WORKSHOP 

adjust the challenge rating  uggesred by its damage 
output up or down by  1 for e\·ery 2 points of difference. 

If the monster relies more on effects with saving 
throws than on attacks, use the monster's save DC 
instead of its attack bonus. 

If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save 

DCs, use the ones that will come up the most often. 

Average Challenge Rating. The monster's final 
challenge rating is the average of its defensive and 
offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or 
down to the nearest challenge rating to determine 
your monster's final challenge rating. For example, if 
the creature's defensive challenge rating is 2 and its 
offensive rating is 3, its final  rating is 3. 

With the final challenge rating, you can determine the 
monster's proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics 
by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points 
by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP 
the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating 
0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise, it is 
worth 10 XP. 

Creating a monster isn't just a number-crunching 
exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you 
create monsters, but the only way to know whether a 
monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster 
in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating 
up or down based on your experiences.

CREATING A  MONSTER STAT BLOCK 
If you want a full  monster stat block, use the following 
method to create your new monster. 

The introduction to the Monster Manual explains all 
the components of a monster's stat block. Familiarize 
yourself with that material before you begin. In the 
course of creating your monster, if you find yourself 
unable to make a decision, let the examples in the 
Monster Manual guide you. 

Once you have a monster concept in mind, follow the 

steps below. 

S TEP 1.  N A ME 
A monster's name should be given as much 
consideration as any other aspect of the monster, 
if not more. 

Your monster might be based on a real-world creature 

or a monster from myth , in which case its name might 
be obvious. If you need to  invent a name, keep in 
mind that the best names either reflect the monster's 
appearance or nature (such as the mimic and the 
owlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul 
and the thri-kreen). 

STEP 2.  SIZE 
Mak6 your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small, 
Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. 

A monster's size determines which die is used to 

calculate its hit points in step 8. Size also determines 
how much space the monster occupies, as discussed in 
the Player's Handbook. 

STEP 3. T Y PE 
A monster's type provides insight into its origins and 
nature. The Monster Manual describes each monster 
type. Choose the type that best fits your concept for 
the monster. 

STEP 4 . ALIGNMENT 
If your monster has no concept of morals, it is 
unaligned. Otherwise, it has an alignment appropriate 
to its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the 
Player's Handbook. 

STEP 5. ABILITY SCORES AND  MODIFIERS 
Monsters, like player characters, have the six ability 
scores. A monster can't have a score lower than 1 or 
higher than 30 in any ability. 

A monster's score in any ability determines its ability 
modifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers 
table in the Player's Handbook. 

If you can't decide what a monster's ability scores 

should be, look for comparable monsters in the Monster 
Manual and mimic their ability scores. For example, 
if your monster is roughly as smart as a human 
commoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier). 
If it's as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4 
modifier). 

STEP 6.  EXPECTED  CH A LLENGE  R ATING 
Choose a challenge rating for your monster. See step 
1 under "Creating Quick Monster Stats" for more 
information. You will use the proficiency bonus in later 
steps, so jot it down now or remember it. 

STEP 7. ARMOR  CLASS 
A monster's Armor Class has a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your 
monster's Armor Class in one of two ways. 

Use the Table. You can choose an appropriate AC 
based on the monster's expected challenge rating, as 
shown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating 
table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster 
of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the 
AC as you see fit.  For example, the baseline AC for a 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

~75 

challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is 
well armored, raise its AC accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's AC isn't matching up with the expected 
challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affec· 
a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps. 

Determine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car: 
determine an appropriate AC based on the type of arm  -
the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other 
Armor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell). 
Again, don't worry if the monster's AC  isn't matching u 
with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 

If your monster wears manufactured armor, its 

Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see 
the Player's Handbook for armor types). If the monster 
carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC 
as normal. 

A monster that doesn't wear armor might have natur2 

armor, in which case it has an AC equal to  10 +its 
Dexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus. A mons£ 
with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonu 
of +1  to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature 
is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example. 
is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor 
bonus of+9. 

STEP 8.  HIT POINTS 
A monster's hit points have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You  can determine y 
monster's hit points in one of two ways. 

Use the Table. You  can start with the monster's 

-

expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to  determine an 
appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a 
range of hit points for each challenge rating. 

Assign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a 
number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its 
average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren t 
matching up with the expected challenge rating for the 
monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge 
rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on. 

A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want. 
but the size of the die used to  calculate its hit points 
depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Di 
by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d~: 
for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice ru::(cid:173)
a Constitution of 13 (+1  modifier) has 5d8 +5 hit poin-" 
A monster typically has average hit points based on ·-~ 

Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit poi 
has an average of 27 hit points (5  x 4.5 + 5).

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

STEP 9.  DAMAGE VuL "ER..'\BI LITI ES , 
RESISTANCES,  AND hnn ; . "ITIE 
Decide whether your mon  ter ha  \·ulnerability, 
resistance, or immunity to one or more types of 
damage (see the Players Handbook for descriptions 
of the various damage types). . 
ign a vulnerability, 
resistance, or immunity  to a mon  ter only when it's 
intuitive. For example, it make  en  e for a monster 
made of molten lava to have immunity to fire damage. 

Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three 
or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing damage) is like gi\·ing it extra hit points. 
However, adventurers have more resources at higher 
levels to  counteract such defense  . making resistances 
and immunities less relevant at higher levels. 

Effective Hit Points. If a monster has resistance 

or immunity to several damage types- especially 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons-and not all the characters in the 
party possess the means to counteract that resistance 
or immunity, you need to take these defenses into 
account when comparing you r monster's hit points to its 
expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points 
Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply 
the appropriate multiplier to the monster's hit points 
to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of 
gauging its final  challenge rating. (The monster's actual 
hit points shouldn't change.) 

For example, a monster with an expected 

challenge rating of 6,  150 hit points, and resistance 
to  bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points 
(using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose 
of gauging its final challenge rating. 

Monsters don't normally have vulnerability to more 
than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don't 
significantly affect a monster's challenge rating, unless 
a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types 
that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its 
effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate 
the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer 
hit points.

STEP 10. ATTACK BONUSES 
A monster's attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a 
monster's attack bonuses in one of two ways. 

Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 

expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate attack bonus for all the monster's attacks, 
regardless of its ability scores. 

The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each 
challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as 
you see fit  to match whatever concept you have in mind. 
For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge 
rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more 
accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's attack bonus isn't matching up with the 
expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors 
can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in 
later steps. 

Calculate Attack Bonuses. Alternatively, you can 
calculate a monster's attack bonuses the same way 
players calculate the attack bonuses of a character. 

Wpen a monster has an action that requires an attack 

roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus+ 
its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually 
applies its Strength modifier to  melee attacks and its 
Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller 
monsters sometimes use Dexterity for both. 

Again, don't worry if the attack bonuses aren't 

matching up with the expected challenge rating for 
the monster. You  can always adjust a monster's attack 
bonuses later. 

STEP 11.  DAMAGE 
A monster's damage output- the amount of damage it 
deals every round-has a direct bearing on its challenge 
rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's 
damage output in one of two ways. 

Use the Table. You  can start with the monster's 

expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to  determine how 
much damage the monster should deal every round. 
The table presents a range at each challenge rating. 
It doesn't matter how this damage is apportioned or 
distributed; for example, a monster might deal the 
damage every round with a single attack, or the damage 
could be split among multiple attacks against one or 
more foes. 

Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine 
the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster 
is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals 
is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, 
some portion of the damage might be poison damage 
instead of slashing damage. 

If you want the damage output to vary slightly from 

round to round, you can translate the damage range into 
a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) 
or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple 
attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster 
deals 15- 20 damage per round. If you imagine the 
creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could 
give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average 
17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate 
attacks that deal1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each; or 
use any other combination where the average damage 
output falls within the desired range. 

Base the Damage on the Weapon. Alternatively, 

you can use a die expression to represent the damage 
that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on 
whatever weapon it is using. 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHO P 

actions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10 
fire  damage to any creature that hits the balor with a 
melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all 
creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each 
of the balor's turns. If you assume that one character ~ 
the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hittir::; 
it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's 
damage output per round increases by 20. 

STEP 12.  SAVE DCs 
A monster might have an attack or some other trait 
that requires a target to make a saving throw. The sa,·e 
DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the 
monster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can 
determine save DCs in one of two ways. 

Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 

expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a tar  e· 
to make a saving throw. 

Calculate the DCs. Alternatively, you can calculate 

a monster's save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster's 
proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability 
modifier. You  choose the ability that best applies. 

For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant 

ability is probably the monster's Constitution. If 
the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant 
ability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, 
or Charisma. 

Don't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with 

the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other 
factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as 
shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the sa  -
DCs later on. 

STEP 13.  SPECIAL TRAITS ,  ACTIONS,  AND 
REACTIONS 
Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance), specia:. 
actions (such as· Superior Invisibility), and special 
reactions (such as Parry) can improve a  monster's 
combat effectiveness and potentially increase its 
challenge rating. 

I, 

Don't worry if the damage output isn't matching up 

with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 
Other factors can affect a monster's cha llenge rating, 
as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a  monster's damage output later on. 

Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws 

or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons. 
If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how 

much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the 
type of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples. 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals 

damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a 
greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals ld12 
slashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier, 
as is normal for that weapon. 

Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that 
deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon 
dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's 
Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. 
For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately 
sized greataxe deals 3dl2 slashing damage (plus its 
Strength bonus), instead of the normalldl2. 

A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a 

weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule 
that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes 
larger is too big for the creature to use at all. 

Overall Damage Output. To determine a monster's 

overall damage output, take the average damage it 
deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them 
together. If a monster has different attack options, use 
the monster's most effective attacks to determine its 
damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two 
greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The 
greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack 
routine determines the fire giant's damage output. 

If a monster's damage output varies from round to 

round, calculate its damage output each round for the 
first three rounds of combat, and take the average. 
For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack 
routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals 
an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath 
weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets 
(and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, 
the dragon will probably get to  use its breath weapon 
once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average 
damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 
37 + 37) + 3, or 54 damage (rounded down). 

When calculating a monster's damage output, also 
account for special off-turn damage-dealing features , 
such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair 

ATTACK  RIDERS 
Many  monsters have attacks that do more than  deal  damage. 
Some effects that can  be added to an attack to give  it a 
flavorful  twist include: 

•  Adding damage of a different type to the attack 
•  Having the monster grapple the target on a  hit 
•  Allowing the  monster to knock the target prone on  a  hit 
•  Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits  and 

the target fails  a saving throw 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

The Monster Features table list  \·arious features that 

you can plunder from the Monster j\tfanual.  The table 
notes which features increase a monster's effective 
Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus. or damage output 
for the purpose of determining its cha llenge rating. (The 
features don't actually change the monster's statistics-) 
Features that have no effect on a monster's challenge 
rating are noted with a dash (-)-

When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions 
to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need 
them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder 
to run) the monster becomes. 

Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting. The impact 
that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special 
traits have on a monster's challenge rating depends 
on the spells that the monster can cast Spells that 
deal more damage than the monster's normal attack 
routine and spells that increase the monster's AC or 
hit points need to be accounted for when determining 
the monster's final challenge rating. See the "Special 
Traits" section in the introduction of the Monster 
Manual for more information on these two special traits. 

STEP 14.  SPEED 
Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile 
monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet) In addition to 
its walking speed, a monster might have one or more 
other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying,  or 
swimming speed. 

Flying Monster. Increase the monster's effective 

Armor Class by  2 (not its actual A C) if it can fly and deal 
damage at range and if its expected challenge rating 
is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater 
ability to deal with flying creatures). 

STEP 15.  SAVING THROW BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to 
certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving 
throws tied to a particular ability. 

A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low 

ability score. For example, an undead monster with a 
low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw 
bonus to account for the fact that it's more difficult to 
charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate. 

A saving throw bonus is equal to  the monster's 

proficiency bonus+ the monster's relevant 
ability modifier. 

A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses 

has a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC 
(not its actual AC) should be raised when determining 
its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, 
increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five  or more 
bonuses, increase its effective AC by 4. 

STEP 16.  FINAL CHALLENGE  RATING 
At this point, you have all the statistical information 
you need to calculate the monster's final challenge 
rating. This step is identical to step 4 under "Creating 
Quick Monster Stats." Calculate the monster's defensive 
challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then 
take the average to get its final challenge rating. 

STEP 17.  SKILL BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can 
give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability 
checks related to  that skill. For example, a monster 
with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks, while a duplicitous monster might 
have a bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks. 

You  can double the proficiency bonus to account for 
heightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is 
so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma 
(Deception) checks is equal to double its proficiency 
bonus + its Charisma modifier. 

Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster's 

challenge rating. 

STEP 18.  CONDITION IMMUNITIES 
A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating 
conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on 
its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various 
conditions, see appendix A of the Player's Handbook. 
As with damage immunities, condition immunities 
should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes 
sense that a stone golem can't be poisoned, since it's a 
construct without a nervous system or internal organs. 

STEP 19.  SENSES 
A monster might have one or more of the following 
special senses, which are described in the Monster 
Manual:  blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, and 
truesight. Whether the monster has special senses or 
not has no bearing on its challenge rating. 

Passive Perception Score. All  monsters have a 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which is most 
often used to determine whether a monster detects 
approaching or hidden enemies. A monster's passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. 
If the monster has proficiency in the Perception skill, its 
score is 10 +its Wisdom (Perception) bonus. 

STEP 20.  LANGUAGES 
Whether a monster can speak a language has no 
bearing on its challenge rating. 

A monster can master as many spoken languages as 
you want, although few monsters know more than one 
or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have 
no spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks 
the ability to speak might still understand a language. 
Telepathy. Whether or not a monster has telepathy 

----------------

has no bearing on its challenge rating. For more 
information on telepathy, see the Monster Manual. 
NPC  STAT BLOCKS 
Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks 
for common NPC archetypes such as bandits and 
guards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those tips 
include adding racial traits from the Player's Handbook, 
equipping NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor, 
weapons, and spells.

If you want to take an NPC stat block and adapt it for 
a specific monster race, apply the ability modifiers and 
add the features listed in the NPC Features table. If the 
NPC's AC,  hit points, attack bonus, or damage changes, 
recalculate its challenge rating. 

CREATING NPCs FROM  SCRATCH 
If you need completely new statistics for an NPC, you 
have two options: 

•  You  can create an NPC stat block (similar to the ones 

in  the Monster Manual) as you would a monster stat 
block, as discussed in the previous section. 
You  can build the NPC as you would a player 
character, as discussed in the Player's Handbook. 

If you decide to build an NPC the same way you build 
a player character, you can skip choosing a background 
and instead pick two skill proficiencies for the NPC.

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

The NPC Features table summarizes the ability 

modifiers and features of variou  nonhuman races, as 
well as various creatures from the Monster Manual with 
a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers 
and add these features to  the  P Cs stat block, then 
determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would 
for a monster. Features that can affect a monster's 
challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table. 
The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level, 
just like a character, rather than by its challenge rating. 
If the monster you want to use isn't listed on the table, 

use the process described below under "Monsters 
with Classes." 

MONSTERS WITH  CLASSES 
You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's 
Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example, 
you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with 
four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would 
be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian"). 

Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains 

all the class features for every class level you add, with 
the following exceptions: 

The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of 
the added class. 
For each class level you add, the monster gains one 
Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring 
the class's Hit Die progression. 
The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its 
challenge rating, not its class levels. 

Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, 
feel  free to  tweak its ability scores as you see fit  (for 
example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so 
that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make 
whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need 
to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had 
designed the monster from scratch. 

Depending on the monster and the number of class 
levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change 
very little or increase dramatically. For example, a 
werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much 
greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit 
points, spells, and other class features that an ancient 
red dragon gains from five  levels of wizard don't 
increase its challenge rating. 

CREATING A  SPELL 
When creating a new spell, use existing spells as 
guidelines. Here are some things to consider: 

If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it 
all the time, it might be too powerful for its level. 
A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser 
effect, depending on the spell. 
Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one 
that works only against good dragons. Though such 
a spell could exist in the world, few characters will 
bother to learn or prepare it  unless they know in 
advance that doing so will be worthwhile. 

•  Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. 
Wizards and sorcerers don"t typically have access to 

healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell 
to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf. 

I , 

-----------------------------

SPELL DAMAGE 
For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage 
table to  determine approximately how much damage is 
appropriate given the spell's level. The table assumes 
the spell deals half damage on a successful saving 
throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal 
damage on a successful save, you can increase the 
damage by 25 percent. 

You  can use different damage dice than the ones 

in the table, provided that the average result is about 
the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. 
For example, you could change a cantrip's damage 
from  ldlO (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing 
the maximum damage and making an average result 
more likely.

HEALING  SPELLS 
You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine 
how many hit points a healing spell restores. A cantrip 
shouldn't offer healing. 

CREATING A  MAGIC  ITEM 
The magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure,"  are but a few 
of the magic treasures that characters can discover 
during their adventures. If your players are seasoned 
veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either 
modify an existing item or come up with something new. 

MODIFYING AN  ITEM 
The easiest way to invent a new item is to  tweak an 
existing one. If a paladin uses a flail  as her main 
weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a 
flail instead of a sword. You  can turn a ring of the ram 
into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of 
protection, all without altering the item's  properties. 
Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that 
deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of 
another type. A flame  tongue sword could deal lightning 
damage instead of fire , for example. One capability 
can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily 
become a potion of stealth. 

You  can also modify an item by fusing it with 

properties from another item. For example, you could 
combine the effects of a helm of comprehending 
languages with those of a helm of telepathy into a 
single helmet. This makes the item more powerful 
(and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break 
your game. 

Finally, remember the tools that are provided for 

modifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure."  Giving an item 
an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can 
alter its flavor significantly. 

CREATING A  NEW ITEM 
If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can 
create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a 
character do something he or she couldn't do before, or 
improve the character's ability to do something he or she 
can do already. For exa mple, the ring of jumping lets its 
wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what 
a character can already do. A ring of the ram , however, 
gives a character the ability to deal force damage. 

The simpler your approach. the easier it is for a 
character to  use the item in play. Giving the item 
charges is fine, especially if it ha  several different 
abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always 
active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is 
easier to rna nage. 

POWER LEVEL 
If you make an item that lets a cha racter kill whatever 
he or she hits with it,  that item will  likely unbalance your 
game. On the other hand , an item whose benefit rarely 
comes into play isn't much of a rewa rd and probably not 
worth doling out as one. 

Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide 
to help you determine how powerful an item should be, 
based on its rarity.

Maximum Spell Level. This column of the table 

indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should 
confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited 
property. For example, a common item might confer 
the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, 
if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item 
might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell 
more frequently. 

Maximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus 

to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this 
column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the 
item's rarity. 

ATTUNEMENT 
Decide whether the item requires a character to be 
attuned to it to  use its properties. Use these rules of 
thumb to help you decide: 

If having all the characters in a party pass an item 
around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, 
the item should require attunement. 
If the item grants a bonus that other items also 
grant, it's a good idea to require attunement so that 
characters don't try to collect too many of those items. 

CREATING NEW 
CHARACTER OPTIONS 
If the options for player characters in the Player's 
Handbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign, 
consult the following sections for advice on creating 
new race, class, and background options. 

CREATING A  RACE  OR SUBRACE ----
This section teaches you how to modify existing races, 
as well as create new ones. The most important step in 
customizing or designing races for your campaign is 

to start with the story behind the race or subrace you 
wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in 
your campaign will help you make decisions during the 
creation process. Ask yourself several questions: 

Why does my campaign need the race to be playable? 
What does the race look like? 
How would I describe the race's culture? 
Where do the members of this race live? 
Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's 
history and culture that make the race compelling 
from a storytelling standpoint? 

•  What is the race's relationship to the other 

playable races? 

•  What classes and backgrounds are well suited to 

members of the race? 
What are the race's signature traits? 

•  In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from 

the other subraces of the parent race? 

Compare the race you  have in mind with the other 

race options available to players, to make sure that the 
new race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing 
options (which would result in the race being unpopular) 
or completely overshadow them (so that players don't 
feel  as if the other options are inferior). 

When the time comes to design the game elements 
of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's 
existing races and let them inspire you. 

CosMETIC ALTERATIONS 
A simple way to modify an existing race is to change 
its appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need 
not affect its game elements. For example, you could 
transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without 
changing their racial traits at all. 

CULTURAL ALTERATIONS 
In your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of 
forest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and 
dwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you 
change the culture of a race, you can also make minor 
alterations to the race's proficiencies and traits to reflect 
that culture. 

For example, imagine that the dwarves of your world 

are seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You  could 
add the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that 
dwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency 
with waterborne vehicles instead of artisan's tools. 
These two small changes tell a different story than 
the default assumptions about dwarves in the Player's 
Handbook, without changing the power level of the race. 

CREATING A  NEW SUBRACE 
Creating a new subrace is more involved than making 
some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it 
does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of 
options for a particular race, rather than replacing some 
options with other ones. 

The following example walks through the creation of 
an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in 
the D&D multi verse, so you already have some stories to 
draw on when building its traits. 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP 

limited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is 
a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the 
subrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us 
with the following features for the eladrin subrace: 
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score 

increases by  1. 

Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the 

longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 

Fey Step. You can cast the misty step spell once usin 
this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish 
a short or long rest. 

CREATING A  NEW RACE 
When creating a race from scratch, begin with the 
story and proceed from there. Compare your creation 
to  the other races of your world, and borrow freely 
from the traits of other races. As an example, consider 
the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a 
celestial heritage. 

EXAMPLE  RACE:  AASIMAR 
Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, 
aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These 
folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrou 
hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often 
attempt to pass as humans in order to  right wrongs and 
defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawin 
undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive  -
to fit  into society, although they usually rise to  the top, 
becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. 

You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoin· 

to  the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odd 
reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of 
good and evil in your campaign. 

Here are our basic goals for the aasimar: 

•  Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. 

Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what 
tieflings are to fiends and humans. 

Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of 
the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point 
for coming up with the new race's traits. Since we wam 
aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes 
sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead o: 
Intelligence and Charisma. 

Like tieflings,  aasimar have darkvision. Instead of 

resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance 
to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. 
However, radiant damage isn't as common as fire 
damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage 
as well, making them good at facing undead. 

The tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model 

for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage. 
replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar leveL 
that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestrY. 
However, the aasimar's expanded resistance might 
-
require limiting this trait to basic utility spells. 

Filling in the rema ining details, we end up with the 

following racial traits for the aasimar: 

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases 

by  1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. 

ExAMPLE  SuBRACE:  ELADRIN 
Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin 
live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities 
sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing 
briefly in  mountain valleys or deep forest glades before 
fading back into the Feywild. 

The elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include 
an ability score increase, a weapon training feature, 
and two or three additional traits. Given the story of 
the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an 
eladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate. There's 
no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by 
high elves and wood elves. 

An  ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves 

is their ability to step through the boundary between the 
planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing 
somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a 

286 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S WORKSHOP 

Age. Aasimar mature at the  arne rate as humans but 

live a few years longer. 

Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar 
are often good. However, some aasimar fall  into evil, 
rejecting their heritage. 

Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned

can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

Celestial Resistance. You have  resistance to necrotic 

damage and radiant damage. 

Celestial Legacy. You know the light can trip. Once 
you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration 
spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do 
so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, 
you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 
3rd-level spell, and you  regain the ability to  do so when 
you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells. 

Languages. You  can speak, read, and write Common 

and Celestial. 

MODIFYING A  CLASS 
The classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide 
range of character archetypes, but your campaign world 
might have need of something more. The following 
section discusses ways to modify existing classes to 
better serve your game's needs. 

CHANGING PROFICIENCIES 
Changing a class's  proficiencies is a safe and simple way 
to  modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping 
out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make 
a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can 
change the flavor of a class in subtle ways. 

For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your 

world might worship a patron deity, performing secret 
missions in that deity's name. To  reflect this cultural 
detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a 
rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could 
even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues 
who belong to this guild. 

You  can also change armor and weapon proficiencies 

to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, 
you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity 
belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of 
material goods, other than magic items useful for their 
divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they 
are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons 
other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove 
the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this 
faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and 
nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up 
for the loss of proficiencies- something like the monk's 
Unarmored Defense class feature , but presented as a 
divine blessing. 

CHANGING SPELL LISTS 
Modifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on 
a character's power but can change the flavor of a class 
significantly. In your world , paladins might not swear 
their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful 
sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build 
a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect 
their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. 
Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class. 

Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. 

Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, 
they have the potential to use certain spells more times 
in a day than other classes do. 

RESTRICTING  CLASS ACCESS 
Without changing the way a class functions, you can 
root it more firmly in the world by associating the class 
with a particular race or culture. 

For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, 
warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions 
of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges 
might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn 
might be the only creatures capable of becoming 
sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be 
human. You  could break that down still further: bards 
of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards 
of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes 
discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who 
specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human 
cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and 
so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect 
entirely separate religions associated with different 
races or cultures. 

You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing 
a player character to break these restrictions. Can a 
half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic 
traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact 
despite having no connection to a culture that normally 
produces warlocks? As always, it's better to  say yes and 
use the player's desire as an opportunity to develop the 
character's story and that of your world, rather than 
shutting down possibilities. 

SUBSTITUTING CLASS  FEATURES 
If one or more features of a given class don't exactly 
fit  the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull 
them out of the class and replace them with new 
ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure 
that the new options are just as appealing as the 
ones you are removing, and that the substitute class 
features contribute to the class's effectiveness at social 
interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those 
being replaced. 

Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a 

particular character concept, and any class feature you 
replace is also removing an aspect of that character. 
Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit  a 
specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player 
trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one 
modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic 
book, or movie). 

CHAPTER  9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

Once you have the concept for the class option in 

mind , it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure 
where to begin, look at the existing options and see w  -
class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for 
two class options to have similar features, and it's al  o 
fine  to look at other classes for examples of mechanics 
you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each 
class feature , ask the following questions: 

How does the class feature reinforce the story or 
theme of the class option? 
Is there an existing feature that can be used 
as a model? 
How does the new class feature compare to other 
features of the same level? 

VARIANT:  SPELL POINTS 
One way to modify how a class feels is to  change how _ 
uses its spells. With this variant system, a character \ 
has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead 
spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more 
flexibility,  at the cost of greater complexity. 

In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on - ~ 
level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cosr  -
spell points of slots from  1st to 9th level. Cantrips don·· 
require slots and therefore don't require spell points. 

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast you;(cid:173)

spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool 
of spell points instead. You  expend a number of spell 
points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then us~ 
that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell po-(cid:173)
total to less than 0,  and you regain all spent spell poin (cid:173)
when you finish a long rest. 

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing(cid:173)
cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each 
level of 6th or higher. You  can't create another slot of  · -
same level until you finish a long rest. 

The number of spell points you have to spend is ba 
on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell 
Points by Level table. Your level also determines the 
maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though 
you might have enough points to create a slot above this 
maximum, you can't do so. 

The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, 

clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin o~ 
ranger, halve the character's level in that class and the 
consult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or ro 
(Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that 
class by three. 

This system can be applied to monsters that cast 

spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that 
you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a 
monster can be a hassle.

The first step is to figure out what class feature or 
group of class features you're going to replace. Then 
you need to evaluate what each feature provides to  the 
class, so that the features you are adding don't make the 
class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following 
questions about a feature you're replacing: 

What impact does replacing the feature have on 
exploration, social interaction, or combat? 
Does replacing the feature affect how long the party 
can continue adventuring in a day? 
Does the feature consume resources provided 
elsewhere in the class? 
Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained 
after a short rest, a long rest, or some other 
length of time? 

Armed with answers to these questions, you can start 
designing new features that replace the ones you are 
removing. It's fine  if the new class features drift closer 
to  exploration, social interaction, or combat than the 
ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. 
For example, if you replace an exploration-focused 
feature with something purely combat focused , you've 
just made that class more powerful in combat, and it 
could overshadow the other classes in a way that you 
didn't intend. 

There's no formula that can tell you how to design 

new class features. The best place to start is by looking 
at other class features, or at spells, feats , or any other 
rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to 
have some missteps, as features that seem good on the 
surface fall  apart in play. That's all right. Everything 
you design will need to be playtested. When introducing 
new class features, be sure the players using them are 
comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back 
and make some changes after seeing them in play., 

CREATING NEW CLASS  OPTIONS 
Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics 
choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial 
archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and 
so forth.  Creating a new option doesn't require you to 
remove anything from the class, but any new option 
you add should be compared to existing options to 
make sure it's no more or less powerful, yet remains 
distinctive in flavor.  Like anything in class design, be 
prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if 
things aren't playing out the way you want them to.

CREATING A  BACKGROUND 
A well-crafted background can help a player create a 
character that feels like an exciting addition to your 
campaign. It helps define the character's place in the 
world, rather than what a character is in terms of game 
mechanics. 

Instead of focusing on a generic character 

background, such as merchant or wanderer, think 
about the factions , organizations, and cultures of 
your campaign and how they might be leveraged to 
create flavorful  backgrounds for player characters. For 
example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep 
background that is functionally similar to a sage 
background, but which ties a character more closely to a 
place and organization in your world. 

A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep 
background probably has friends among the 
Avowed-the monks who maintain the great library 
at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library 
and consult its lore freely,  while others must donate 
a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are 
allowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's 
enemies, and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes 
of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages 
and protectors of knowledge. It's possible to  envision 
many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the 
character's background and approach the character in 
search of assistance. 

To  create your own background, follow these steps. 

STEP 1.  ROOT lT IN YOUR WORLD 
To ground a new background in your campaign's 
setting, determine what element of your campaign the 
background is tied to:  a faction. an organization,  a trade, 
a person, an event, or a location. 

STEP 2.  SUGGEST P ERSO NA L  CHARACTERISTICS 
Create tables of suggested characteristics-personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws-that fit the background, 
or plunder entries from the tables presented in the 
Player's Handbook. Even if your players don't use 
the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the 
background's place in your world. The tables need not 
be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough. 

STEP 3. ASSIGN  PROFICIENCIES  OR LANGUAGES 
Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies 
for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies 
with languages on a one-for-one basis. 

STEP 4'. INCLUDE  STARTING  EQUIPMENT 
Make sure your background offers a package of starting 
equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that 
a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting 
equipment should include items that a character would 
have acquired prior to  becoming an adventurer, as well 
as one or two items unique to the background. 

For example, starting equipment for a character with 
the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a 
set of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five  candles, 
a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the 
symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 
gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of 
Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your 
discretion, it might also contain a useful map. 

STEP  5. SETTLE  ON A  BACKGROUND  FEATURE 
Choose an existing background feature or create a new 
one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add 
or tweak a few details to make it unique. 

For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background 

might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as 
presented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional 
benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep 
without paying the normal cost. 

A background feature should avoid strict game 

benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack 
roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for 
roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with 
the world. 

For example, the sage's Researcher feature is 

designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn't 
provide information or an automatic success for a check. 
Instead, if a character with the sage background fails 
to recall information, he or she instead knows where to 
learn it. This might be a pointer to  another sage or to  a 
library long lost within an ancient tomb. 

The best background features give characters 
a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact 
with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting 
you've devised. 

CHAPTER 9  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S  WORKSHOP 

APPENDIX A:  RANDOM  DUNGEONS 

HIS APPENDIX  HELPS YOU  QUICKLY GENERATE 
a dungeon. The tables work in an iterative 
manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to 
determine the passages and doors found in 
that area. One you have initial passages and 
doors, determine the location and nature of 
subsequent passages, doors, chambers, stairs, and so 
on- each of them generated by rolls on different tables. 

Following these instructions can lead to sprawling 
complexes that more than fill  a single sheet of graph 
paper. If you want to constrain the dungeon , establish 
limits ahead of time on  how far it can grow. 

The most obvious limit to a dungeon's size is the 

graph paper it's drawn on. If a feature would exceed 
the boundaries of the page, curtail it. A corridor might 
turn or come to a dead end at the map's edge, or you can 
make a chamber smaller to fit  the available space. 

Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off 

the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. 
Stairs, shafts, and other features that would normally 
lead to levels you don't plan to map can serve a 
similar purpose. 

STARTING AREA 
The Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of 
corridors at the entrance to your dungeon. When rolling 
for a random starting area, pick one of the doors or 
passages leading into the starting area as the entrance 
to the dungeon as a whole. 

Once you've selected the entrance, roll on the 

appropriate table for each passage or door leading away 
from the starting area. Passages each extend 10 feet 
beyond the starting area. After that point, check on the 
Passage table for each passage to determine what lies 
beyond. Use the Beyond a Door table to  determine what 
lies behind doors and secret doors.

its width. If the passage branches from another passage 
roll a d12 on the Passage Width table. If it comes from 
a chamber, roll a d20 on that table,  but the width of the 
passage must be at least 5 feet smaller than the longest 
dimension of the chamber.

CONNECTING AREAS 
When your map is done, consider adding doors between 
chambers and passages that are next to each other but 
otherwise not connected. Such doors create more paths 
through the dungeon and expand players' options. 

If your dungeon consists of more than one level, be 
sure that any stairs, pits, and other vertical passages 
line up between levels. If you're using graph paper, 
lay a new page on top of your existing map, mark the 
locations of stairs and other features shared by the two 
levels, and begin mapping the new level. 

STOCKING A  DUNGEON 
Creating a map for your dungeon is only half the fun. 
Once you have the layout, you need to decide what 
challenges and rewards are to be found in the dungeon's 
passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space 
should be stocked with interesting sights, sounds, 
objects, and creatures. 

You  don't need to have every last detail of your 

dungeon plotted out. You  can get by with nothing more 
than a list of monsters, a list of treasures, and a list of 
one or two key elements for each dungeon area. 

CHAMBER PURPOSE 
A room's purpose can help determine its furnishings 
and other contents. 

For each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its 
purpose or use the tables below to generate ideas. Each 
type of dungeon described in the "Dungeon Purpose" 

APPENDIX A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS 

section of chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," has its 
own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon's 
purpose. For example, if you're building a tomb, use the 
Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose 
of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are 
followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, 
which you can use if your dungeon isn't an exact fit  for 
one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to 
mix things up. 

Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon 

can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end 
up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber 
next door serves as storage. It can be fun to try to  make 
sense of such strange design ideas, but make changes 
as you see fit.  You can set aside a few key rooms and 
create specific contents for  them.

CHAMBER  CONTENTS 
Once you  have a sense of the purpose of the various 
dungeon chambers, you can think about the contents 
of those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table 
allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or 
you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose 
contents, be sure to include an interesting, colorful 
assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown 
on this table, refer to "Dungeon Dressing" later in this 
appendix for additional items and elements to fill  rooms. 
In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant 

inhabitant" is a creature that controls an area. Pets 
and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant 
inhabitant. "Random creatures" are scavengers or 
nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups 
passing through the area. They include such creatures 
as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust 
monsters. See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for 
more information on random encounters.

MONSTERS  AND  MOTIVATIONS 
See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance on 
creating encounters with monsters. To foster variety 
and suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying 
difficulty. 

A powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon 

sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to 
rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon 

APPENDIX  A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS 

might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of 
smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the 
chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their 
utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party's brave 
thief makes off with a few coins from its hoard. 

Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When 

placing monsters in your dungeon, consider their 
relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes 
toward adventurers. Characters might be able to 
appease a hungry beast by offering it food,  and smarter 
creatures have complex motivations. The Monster 
Motivation table lets you use a monster's goals to define 
its presence in the dungeon. 

For large groups of monsters encountered across 

multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire 
group, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals.

RANDOM  DUNGEON  HAZARDS 
Hazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because 
monsters either clear them away or avoid them. 
Shriekers and violet fungi are described in  the 

Monster Manual.  The other hazards on the table are 
described in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments."

RANDOM  OBSTACLES 
Obstacles block progress through the dungeon. In some 
cases, what adventurers consider an obstacle is an 
easy path for the dungeon's inhabitants. For example, 
a flooded chamber is a barrier to many characters but 
easily navigated by water-breathing creatures. 

Obstacles can affect more than one room. A chasm 

might run through several passages and chambers, 
or send cracks through the stonework in a wider area 
around it.  An area of battering winds that emanates 
from a magic altar could stir the air less dangerously for 
hundreds of feet in all directions.

RANDOM TRAPS 
If you need a trap quickly or want to drop random 
traps into a dungeon, use the sample traps presented 
in  chapter 5, "Adventure Environments" or the tables 
below. If you use the tables, start with the Trap Effects 
and Trap Trigger tables to  decide the type of trap, 
then use the Trap Damage S everity tables to decide 
how deadly it should be. For more information on trap 
damage severity, see chapter 5.

RANDOM TRICKS 
Tricks are quirkier and less deadly than traps. Some 
are effects left  behind by the dungeon's creators, while 
others might be manifestations of the strange magical 
energy suffusing the dungeon. 

The following tables allow you to generate random 
tricks. Roll first to  determine an object that the trick 
is placed on, then roll to determine the nature of the 
trick. Some tricks are permanent effects that can't be 
dispelled; others are temporary or can be neutralized 
with a dispel magic spell. You decide which is which.

APPENDIX A  I RANDOM  DUNGEONS 

RANDOM TREASURES 
Use the tables and guidelines in chapter 7,  "Treasure" to 
determine the treasure in each area of your dungeon. 

EMPTY ROOMS 
An empty room can be a godsend for characters who 
need a safe place to take a short rest. Characters can 
also barricade themselves there and take a long rest. 

Sometimes such a room isn't as empty as it appears. If 

the characters search a room carefully, you can reward 
them with a secret compartment containing a journal 
belonging to  a previous inhabitant, a map leading to 
another dungeon, or some other discovery. 

DUNGEON  DRESSING 
The tables in this section provide miscellaneous 
items and points of interest that can be placed in your 
dungeon. Dungeon dressing can help establish the 
atmosphere of a dungeon, give clues about its creators 
a nd history, provide the basis for tricks and traps, or 
encourage exploration. 

To  generate dungeon dressing at random, roll once on 
each of the following tables: Noises, Air, and Odors. Roll 
as often as you like on the other tables in this section, or 
choose appropriate furnishings for the area.

~ REAT!NG A MAP FOR AN ADVENTURE  IS A FUN , 

challenging, and time-consuming endeavor. 
However, unless you  have something specific 
in mind, you're better off conserving your 
time and energy by repurposing an existing 
map. Published adventures and the Internet 

are terrific sources for maps. A few sample maps are 
included here as well. Use them as you will!
